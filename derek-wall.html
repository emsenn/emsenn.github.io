<h3 id="org88aa365">"Why the left needs Elinor Ostrom"</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org88aa365">
<p>
In 2018, <a href=aaron-vansintjan.html>Aaron Vansintjan</a> interviewed Derek Wall about his book <a href=derek-wall-why-the-left-needs-elinor-ostrom.html>"Elinor Ostrom's rules for radicals: Cooperative alternatives beyond markets and states"</a>
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Source</dt><dd><a href="http://unevenearth.org/2018/01/why-the-left-needs-elinor-ostrom/">http://unevenearth.org/2018/01/why-the-left-needs-elinor-ostrom/</a></dd>
</dl>

<p>
The interview begins with Vansintjan relating his experience with the <a href=2012-quebec-student-strike.html>2012 Quebec Student Strike</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
At some point during the Quebec student strike of 2012, I found myself in an enormous protest in downtown Montreal. We took up the street as far as the eye could see. All of a sudden, a mass of people dressed in black stormed down the other half of the road. The anarchist contingent, going the wrong way.
</p>

<p>
The effect was incredible: here we were, in the thousands, all walking together in one direction to demand tuition subsidized by the state, and simultaneously, thousands of others were calling for an end to the state, walking the other way. I climbed onto the concrete divider in the center of the street separating the two lanes, unsure of which side I should join.
</p>

<p>
One protest, two directions: a neat metaphor for the tension in the Left today. We are trying to choose between supporting welfare programs and rejecting the top-down nature of the state itself. Just as education, health insurance, and welfare need to be protected, the state plays a key role in environmental destruction, securitization and policing, and international wars. How can we resolve this tension?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Vansintjan then poses that "[i]f you try and figure out what role the state should have, you'll inevitable led to a list of great thinkers," and lists some:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href=adam-smith.html>Adam Smith</a></li>
<li><a href=karl-marx.html>Karl Marx</a></li>
<li><a href=john-maynard-keynes.html>John Maynard Keynes</a></li>
<li><a href=friedrich-hayek.html>Friedrich Hayek</a></li>
<li><a href=thomas-piketty.html>Thomas Piketty</a></li>
<li><a href=amartya-sen.html>Amartya Sen</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Then, Vansintjan says there's one person who most people don't list, but probably should: <a href=elinor-ostrom.html>Elinor Ostrom</a>. This segues into Vansintjan's interview with Wall, about Wall's book <a href=derek-wall-why-the-left-needs-elinor-ostrom.html>"Elinor Ostrom's rules for radicals: Cooperative alternatives beyond markets and states"</a>, which Wall describes as a "bite-size[d] take" on his much-longer book, <a href=derek-wall-the-sustainable-economics-of-elinor-ostrom-commons-contestation-and-craft.html>"The sustainable economics of Elinor Ostrom: Commons, contestation, and craft"</a>.
</p>

<p>
The format of "Elinor Ostrom's rules for radicals" is an open homage to <a href=saul-alinksy-rules-for-radicals-a-pragmatic-primer-for-realistic-radicals.html>Saul Alinksy's "Rules for Radicals: A Pragmatic Primer for Realistic Radicals"</a>.
</p>

<p>
Here's some quotes from Wall's part of the interview:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
In politics we tend to think in terms of conspiracies and slogans.  Politics is too often seen as replacing an elite with an alternative set of leaders. This is at best insufficient. I am not fundamentally against electoral politics in a liberal context but they are limited.  The Ostrom approach is about participation, creating a deeply democratic society instead of replacing ‘bad people’ with ‘good people’ at the top of a structure.
</p>

<p>
In turn, we too often have a kind of magical and ideological thinking where we are for ‘good things’ and against ‘bad things’, promoting broad slogans or writing manifestos with sets of demands.  Instead we need to view the good things we would like to achieve such as ecology, equality, and freedom as challenges to meet.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
Ostrom’s micro analysis about how you build practical institutional structures to promote more ecological, equal and diverse societies, can be rejected as irrelevant by the left.  Constructing these structures is a waste of time in capitalism because Marxists might argue capitalist systems will destroy them.  Indeed it is good to be critical of Ostrom from this perspective because she didn’t focus on the real tragedy of the commons, the fact that commons were enclosed and commoners expelled by the rich and powerful.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
[R]evolutions can only be the start. Any post-revolutionary society is in danger of reproducing the previous ways of doing things. Therefore thinking carefully about institutional decisions to make sure that post-revolutionary structures work to promote participation and genuine democratic control is essential but too often forgotten.  Ostrom was fascinated by the practice of participation and looked in some detail at how to build alternative structures, in doing so she provides both radical inspiration and practical suggestions.
</p>
</blockquote>

Indeed it is good to be critical of Ostrom from this perspective because she didn’t focus on the real tragedy of the commons, the fact that commons were enclosed and commoners expelled by the rich and powerful. However if you don’t think about the nuts and bolts of governance in a post capitalist society, revolution, in my opinion, will fail to produce institutions that genuinely promote liberation.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Getting there by destroying repressive power structures is the task of revolutionaries and remains essential.  However revolutions can only be the start. Any post-revolutionary society is in danger of reproducing the previous ways of doing things. Therefore thinking carefully about institutional decisions to make sure that post-revolutionary structures work to promote participation and genuine democratic control is essential but too often forgotten.  Ostrom was fascinated by the practice of participation and looked in some detail at how to build alternative structures, in doing so she provides both radical inspiration and practical suggestions.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
My key focus is how to challenge the ecological crisis that threatens both humanity and other species.  This is a crisis of economic growth, we can’t produce, consume, and waste at increasing levels without challenging basic biological cycles on planet Earth.  So Marx’s analysis of Capitalism remains to me vital to understanding the cause of ecological crisis in terms of an entire social and economic system based on growth. Marx once noted, ‘Accumulate, accumulate is Moses and the Prophets’— the secular religion of capitalism puts economic expansion and profit at the centre of everything. Louis Althusser, a highly controversial figure, remains to my mind the most sophisticated reader of Marx. So, yes, I have a passion for thinking about green politics and acting to further green politics but I am keen to be flexible in what I do.
