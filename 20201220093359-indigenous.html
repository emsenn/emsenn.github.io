To be <b><i>indigenous</i></b> can mean two different things, depending on if a <a href="20201216101549-person.html">person</a> is <a href="20201216101254-human.html">human</a> or not. For non-humans, to be indigenous means to have evolved or established a generations-long niche in a physical <a href="20201220093604-environment.html">environment</a>. For humans, being indigenous to a thing means to live focused on seeking a balanced relationship with that thing. Most commonly, the term used in that context is to refer to humans being "indigenous to place," (<a href="20201220094330-braiding_sweetgrass.html">Braiding Sweetgrass</a>) meaning that a person (and their culture) are focused on finding a balanced relationship with the other things in their environment.
