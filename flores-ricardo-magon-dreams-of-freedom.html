<p>
The Russian anarchist Peter Kropotkin explains that no work can be con¬ 
sidered the “intellectual property” of one author or set of authors. In The Con¬ 
quest of Bread,he proclaims, “There is not even a thought, or an invention, which 
is not common property, born of the past and the present.” Before an author can 
express himself, he must first recognize the authority of others, acknowledging 
his allegiance to those who have guided him towards knowledge. 
</p>

<p>
I first learned about Ricardo Flores Mag#n on a Oxazaean beach from the 
anarcho-punk Luis Cardenas who, decked out in his Revolucion X t-shirt, urged 
me to seek out this great “poet, philosopher, and prophet.” I unfortunately lost 
Luis’ contact information in the Cleveland Greyhound terminal years ago, so if 
anyone ever meets him, please tell him I say thanks. 
</p>

<p>
Iam also indebted to the numerous scholars who have given their ad¬ 
vice and support. My thanks go out to Lillian Castillo-Speed, Ward S.Albro, Colin 
McLachlan, Mona Cowen, Richard Swartz, Lyle Brown, Reggie Rodriguez, Juan Go¬ 
mez Quinones, Dana Ward, George Salzman, Eric Rauchway, Fermin Rojas, Omar 
Cortes, Chantal Lopez, and Alfonso Torua Cienfuegos. 
</p>

<p>
In The Conquest of Bread, Kropotkin teaches that the revolution must 
first supply adequate food and shelter before it can progress any further. In that 
spirit. T would like to thank Wade and Lewis Jones and Hiroko and KoichiTamano 
for granting me refuge during the writing of this book. 
</p>

<p>
Most especially, I would like to express my gratitude to two individuals 
</p>

<p>
project, suppiji. ting me materially, 
</p>


<p>
intellectually, emotionally, and spiritually through its darkest hours. Without res¬ 
ervation, I can safely state that this volume would not have been possible without 
the comradeship of Barry Pateman (and the whole gang at the Emma Goldman 
Papers Project) and my golden palamino Benjamin Ehrenreich. 
</p>

<p>
Lastly I dedicate the book to the people who got me walking down the- 
anarchist path in the first place: Food Not Bombs, Homes Not Jails, and the Lucy 
Parsons Center.

This book is largely the result of the mule-headed persistence of Ramsey 
Kanaan of AK Press. For several years, seemingly every time I talked with him, 
Ramsey would ask me, “When are you going to start on the Magon book?” My an¬ 
swer was invariably, “Never.” There were two reasons for this: 1) I didn’t want to 
go to the time and trouble of selecting and translating tens of thousands of words 
of Ricardo Flores Magon’s writings; and 2) I already had a Magon biography in the 
works (written by another author) that I was planning to publish as a See Sharp 
Press title. 
</p>

<p>
Last fall, I had to cancel that title after investing more time, money, and ef¬ 
fort into it than I care to recall. Shortly after that painful decision, Ramsey caught 
me in a moment of weakness and I agreed to produce this volume for AK. 
</p>

<p>
However, I’m not an authority on Mexican history nor on Ricardo Flores 
Magon. So, I suggested that Mitch Verter, who had already translated a number of 
Magon’s writings and who is much more knowledgeable about Mexican history 
than I am, be involved in the project. It’s worked out well. Mitch and I worked as¬ 
siduously for more than six months to produce the book you hold in your hands. 
Mitch was responsible for writing the chronology and the historical introduction, 
for compiling the bibliography, for selecting the bulk of the translated materials, 
and for translating perhaps 20% of them. I had the relatively easy tasks of translat¬ 
ing the bulk of the writings and of editing this volume. 
</p>

<p>
As for my translations, I did my best to preserve Magon’s meaning, 
though at times my translations are far from literal, and in a few places I even 
did some minor copy editing (where there were incomplete sentences, glaring 
grammatical lapses, etc.). The reason for this is that many of Magon’s writings 
were produced under duress—the difficulties of producing an under-funded, un¬ 
der-staffed weekly newspaper while simultaneously fomenting a revolution and 
being viciously persecuted are hard to overstate—so, it’s not surprising that even 
as good a writer as Ricardo Flores Magon made a number of grammatical errors 
in the pieces reproduced here. Under the circumstances, I’ve done what I think 
that Magon would have wanted me to do: I’ve preserved his meaning but fixed 
the errors. 
</p>

<p>
The end result of Mitch’s and my hard work is this volume: the largest 
compilation of English-language translations of Ricardo Flores Magon’s writings

INTRODUCTION

</p>

<p>
When dawn broke on Leavenworth Penitentiary on November 21,1922, 
it found Ricardo Flores Magon dead. With his death, the historical Magonist move¬ 
ment lost its principal figure, but in reality it had ceased to exist years before with 
the imprisonment of Ricardo Flores Magon and Librado Rivera, the suppression 
of the newspaper, Regeneracion , and the abandonment of the struggle by En¬ 
rique Flores Magon and many others. 
</p>

<p>
But the influence of Ricardo Flores Magon was so powerful that despite 
the failure of the revolutionary struggles of Magon’s Partido Liberal Mexicano 
(PLM), Mexico’s anarchists and many other leftists still identified with Magon’s 
ideology, his ethical qualities, his vigor, his consistency and coherence, and his 
explosive style. These thinkers and social activists engaged in activities that co¬ 
incided with Magon’s proposals, and they gave them a direction and dynamic all 
their own. 
</p>

<p>
Despite the death of Ricardo Flores Magon, the historical Magonist move¬ 
ment lived on with the little-studied activities of the survivors of the PLM, such as 
Librado Rivera, Magon’s longtime comrade, who had been imprisoned with him 
in Leavenworth. Until his death in 1932, Rivera was extremely politically active 
in Tamaulipas. Among other things, he edited several periodicals, maintained ties 
with the labor movement, and kept up a correspondence with Sacco and Van- 
zetti (Rivera 1980). For his part, the youngest of the Magonistas, Nicolas T. Bernal, 
continued to play an active role in the Mexican and international anarchist move¬ 
ments until his death in the 1980s (Bernal 1982;Iparrea 1982). Like Librado Ri¬ 
vera, Bernal died in poverty. For her part, Magon’s companera, Maria Brousse, and 
a group of friends, undertook the publication of a good part of Magon’s articles 
and speeches, even though Brousse had running disputes with Rivera and Bernal 
(Bernal 1982, pp. 141-144). 
</p>

<p>
Others made worse use of Magon’s legacy. On the day following his 
death, a disagreeable legend arose: that the Magonist movement was “the precur¬ 
sor of the Mexican Revolution.” An ex-Magonist, Antonio Diaz Soto y Gama, at the 
time a member of congress, delivered an emotional speech in which he notified 
</p>

<p>
the other deputies of Magon’s death and then, undoubtedly with good intentions, 
exalted Ricardo Flores Magon, praising him as the precursor of the revolution. 
The political class, which had benefited from the Mexican Revolution—which 
in reality resulted in only a change of those in power—saw in this estimation of 
Magon an opportunity to co-opt the legacy of an inconvenient national hero, and 
at the same time to claim him as its own antecedent. 
</p>

<p>
So it was that Magonism was incorporated into the official history as the 
precursor of the revolution, in other words as the precursor of the brutal, corrupt, 
authoritarian Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI). The PRI appropriated 
the ideas and actions of Magonism’s first epoch (1900-1910), and propagated 
the false idea that these things comprised the whole of Magonism. That is, the 
PRI presented Magonism as only a liberal ideology and movement, leaving to one 
side the radicalism of post-1910 Magonism. For the state, there were no figures 
such as Zapata, Villa, Carranza, and Obregon to fill the void at the beginning of the 
twentieth century, and as an agitator Francisco I. Madero was an insignificant fig¬ 
ure. It was the Magonists who revolted in 1906 and 1908, who had done tireless 
agitational work with Regeneration, who had organized the PLM in 1905-1906, 
put forward its program, and who had participated in the strikes in Cananea and 
Rio Blanco in 1906 and 1907. But all these things were not preparation for the 
limited political revolution of 1910. Rather, they were preparation for a radical 
economic revolution, which ultimately failed, and whose final important armed 
uprising took place in 1911 in Baja California. And, it’s important to note, this 
linal uprising was suppressed not by the forces of the old Diaz dictatorship, but 
by Madero’s “revolutionaries” (utilizing troops from the old Diaz regime, for fear 
that their own troops would join the actual revolutionaries). 
</p>

<p>
The attempts by government officials to appropriate Ricardo Flores 
Magon have, however, contributed—contrary to the original intentions of the 
appropriators—to keeping this difficult-to-assimilate person in the public eye. In 
1945, the transfer of his remains to the Rotunda of Illustrious Men (Hernandez 
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>stirred in the public the memory of this polarized figure, who on the one</li>
</ol>
<p>
hand was painted as a self-abnegating leader of the anti-Porfirista movement by 
the government, and on the other hand who was still believed by a large part of 
the population to be guilty of “filibusterism,” of conducting a military adventure 
in Baja California in 1911 with the goal of annexing Baja to the United States. 
</p>

<p>
Later, around 1973, the centenary of the birth of Ricardo Flores Magon, 
an important group of academics published many books and articles on Magon 
and Magonism with the support of three government agencies: the Secretary of 
</p>

<p>
Housing and Public Credit, in its Bolettn Bibliogrdfico (Maldonado 1988); the 
National Institute of Historical Studies on the Mexican Revolution, a dependency 
of the Secretary of the Interior; and the Center for Historical Studies on the Labor 
Movement, under the auspices of the Secretary of Labor and Social Forecasts. 
</p>

<p>
But even more important since the end of the historic Magonist move¬ 
ment have been what we can call Magonist narratives or histories, which come 
in many forms and in which one of several aspects of historic Magonism have 
influenced the activities of persons, collectives, and organizations. These narra¬ 
tives constitute the tracks of the dying movement radiating outward in the free 
expression of every one of the protagonists of “the idea.” 
</p>

<p>
The explosive tenant farmer movement in Veracruz in the 1920s, tied 
to the radical campesino movement in the area, had amongst its activities the 
presentation of the theater works of Ricardo Flores Magon (Agetro 1942; Fowler 
1979). The campesino movement in Michoacan had among its primary leaders 
Primo Tapia, who had been involved with the PLM Junta in Los Angeles (Friedrich 
1984).The Nueva Leon anarchist Ricardo Trevino, a key worker in the unfolding 
of revolutionary syndicalism in the workers’movement of Tampico, had been part 
of the Magonist group in San Antonio. In the same part of Tampico, the agrarian 
mobilization was headed by another Magonist, HiginioTanguma (Gonzalez 1987). 
And the reading of Regeneration influenced the social policies of post-revolu¬ 
tionary state governors, such as Felipe Carrillo Puerto (Yucatan), Emilio Portes 
Gil (Tamaulipas), and AdalbertoTejeda (Veracruz). In 1937, Efren Castrejon began 
publishing Regeneration , with his edition being taken over by the Federacion 
Anarquista Mexicana in 1941 (Lopez y Cortes 1999). 
</p>

<p>
But the greatest work in spreading awareness of the thoughts and actions 
of the Magonist movement has been done since the 1970s by Omar Cortes and 
Chantal Lopez through their indispensable EdicionesAntorcha, which has printed 
dozens of books comprising collections of articles from Regeneration , speeches 
by Ricardo Flores Magon, the letters and manifestoes of Emiliano Zapata, etc., etc. 
More recently, Omar and Chantal have with great care and commitment put a 
great many of these works on line in nicely produced, free editions on their web 
site: www.antorcha.net/index/catalogo/catalogo.html. 
</p>

<p>
Beyond this, in the context of workers and campesino struggles, the fig¬ 
ure of Ricardo Flores Magon and the various Magonist slogans were present in the 
second half of the twentieth century in important social movements which were 
not anarchist. In this regard, it’s worth mentioning that several outstanding Marx- 
</p>


<p>

</p>




<p>
ist intellectuals of the Mexican left, such as Jose Revueltas, have turned their eyes 
toward Magonism to lend its support to contemporary social struggles. 
</p>

<p>
More recently, Magonism has inspired the formation and activities of sev¬ 
eral collectives of young people in Mexico City and in other parts of the country. 
In large part these groups have ties to the Biblioteca Social Reconstruir (Social 
Reconstruction Library), an organization formed by Spanish exiles in the 1940s 
following the defeat of the Spanish Revolution in 1938-39, and which, following 
the death of its leading member, Ricardo Mestre, has had to exert extraordinary 
effort simply to survive. 
</p>

<p>
In the case of Oaxaca, Magonism has been forcefully reborn in the land 
of Ricardo Flores Magon’s birth, in the municipality of San Antonio Eloxochitlan. 
Over the last ten years, Magonism has been reaffirmed there, consisting of discus¬ 
sion of the historical movement, a mass visit to Ricardo’s tomb, the orientation of 
the community assembly toward Magonism, and the forging of ties with anarchist 
collectives in different parts of the country and throughout the world. 
</p>

<p>
Also in Oaxaca, since the end of the 1990s the social movement that has 
most openly confronted the state has been propelled by the Consejo Indigena y 
Popular de Oaxaca “Ricardo Flores Magon” (CIPO-RFM), with, obviously, clear Ma- 
gonist orientation.This group, in addition to being the driving force behind many 
popular initiatives, has also created ties with several European collectives. 
</p>

<p>
The examples of Magonist“narratives” are multiplying, and without doubt 
the most eye-catching is found in the Zapatista movement in the indigenous vil¬ 
lages of Chiapas. In this movement two important elements are tied together: the 
appropriation which the Zapatistas are making of the figure of Ricardo Flores 
Magon and the political/social discussion which implies the presence of Mago¬ 
nism in the Zapatista movement. 
</p>

<p>
One of the first and largest municipal rebellions in Chiapas took the 
name of Ricardo Flores Magon, and it’s one of the 29 municipalities located in the 
territory controlled by the Ejercito Zapatista de Liberacion Nacional (EZLN—Za¬ 
patista National Liberation Army). It was begun in theTzeltal community ofTa- 
niperlas on April 9,1998, and since then has endured governmental harassment. 
Within 24 hours of the rebellion’s constitution, the Mexican army invaded the 
community and destroyed its seat of government. But it wasn’t able to destroy the 
community council. (This same municipal council is one of the four municipal 
councils which since August 2003 have constituted the Junta de Buen Gobierno 
“El camino del futuro” [the Council of Good Government,The Way of the Future]. 
These four communities all belong to the “Resistance to Bring a New Dawn,”

<p>
which was established in La Garrucha.) In this rebel municipality, Ricardo Flores 
Magon, the Tzeltals rule themselves without depending on the Mexican govern- 
ment.They have their own systems of justice, health, education, and production, 
based in their own customs and supported by Mexican and foreign activists. 
</p>

<p>
As well, the presence of Magonism in the present-day Zapatista move¬ 
ment leads us to examine the mutual presence in both historic movements. This 
has led us to discover that there was an approach between the two movements 
between 1912 and 1914.This approach implies that the Zapatistas were familiar 
with the anarchist objectives of the Magonist struggle, expressed in the slogan 
iVivaTierra y Libertad!, which since 1910 was the principle Magonist slogan. And 
the struggle forTierra y Libertad was a libertarian revolution, not a “revolution” 
for a change in government, but a revolution whose aim was the destruction of 
the capitalist socioeconomic model and the reconstruction of Mexico based on a 
libertarian schematic nourished by the historical experience of indigenous com¬ 
munity organization. (The formulation of this proposal to turn one’s eyes toward 
the forms of indigenous life had three central proponents within Magonism: Ri¬ 
cardo Flores Magon, Voltairine de Cleyre, and William C. Owen, all of whom from 
the beginning of the decade in 1910 developed and published these ideas.) 
</p>

<p>
In sum, Magonism is certainly close enough to Zapatismo in the present 
epoch; this much is certain, and it implies that Magonism has an important role in 
these moments when the nation-state model is reaching exhaustion, propelling 
us toward a new social compact. 
</p>

<p>
Historical Magonism reaches its centenary in 2006. Following Armando 
Barta (1977), we can say that Magonism consisted of three elements: 1) an ideol¬ 
ogy; 2) a periodical; and 3) an organization. The ideology was formed with the 
input of, among others, Ricardo Flores Magon,Librado Rivera, Praxedis Guerrero, 
William C. Owen, and Voltairine de Cleyre, with Ricardo Flores Magon standing 
above the rest in clarity and forcefulness in expressing the ideology. The periodi¬ 
cal, Regeneration, first appeared in 1900 and for the next 18 years would be the 
instrument of diffusing Magonism in Mexico and the United States. And the orga¬ 
nization was the Partido Liberal Mexicano, which through an exemplary process 
of creation and elaboration of its plan and program saw light in July 1906 (Lopez 
and Cortes 1985). 
</p>

<p>
Even though historical Magonism has long since disappeared, it has con¬ 
tinued and will continue to nourish Magonist “narratives” in many distinct locales, 
which certainly are playing and will continue to play a substantial part in the 
transformation of Mexico.

PREFACE 
</p>

<p>
Mitchell Vertex 2005 
</p>

<p>
In Ricardo Flores Magon’s 1917 play, “Victimas y Verdugos” (Victims and 
Executioners), the worker Jose defends his companion Isabel from a judge who 
arrives with a group of gendarmes to throw her and her sick, dying mother out 
on to the street. After Jose proclaims that the bourgeoisie have prostituted the 
concepts of “justice” and “rights” to forward their own interests and to whip down 
the poor, the judge furiously demands, “Are you an anarchist?” Jose responds, “I 
am a friend of justice, of human justice, of the justice that is not written in the 
codes, of the justice that prescribes that all human beings have the right to live 
without exploiting and without being exploited, without ordering and without 
being ordered.” Falsely believing that he has uncovered the underlying reason for 
Jose’s revolutionary awareness, the judge shouts to his gendarmes, “This man is a 
magonista”—a follower of Ricardo Flores Magon—“Search him!” However, Jose, 
restrained and patted down by the authorities, indignantly responds “I am not a 
magonista: I am an anarchist. An anarchist does not have idols.” 
</p>

<p>
Flores Magon was quite clear about this: about placing principles above 
“leaders.” A prison letter to his brother Enrique and his comrade Praxedis Guer¬ 
rero explains that they must work as “anarchists, even from those who take us as 
their leaders.” Rejecting all forms of coercion, Flores Magon believed that a true 
anarchist would neither order others around nor prescribe a doctrine for others 
to follow. Rather than leading a set of followers, true revolutionaries would inspire 
others to action. He explained,“Let us then, those who are conscious, prepare the 
nonular mentality for when the moment arrives ” This notion of the anarchist 
intellectual as one who points the way rather than commands echoes the classi¬ 
cal, Socratic idea of the philosopher as one who frees shackled slaves from false 
ideas. 
</p>

<p>
Throughout his writing, Ricardo Flores Magon repeatedly describes him¬ 
self as a prophet of emancipation.Traditionally, a prophet does not merely call oth¬ 
ers to justice; his own prophecy is also a response to a calling from beyond him¬ 
self. Flores Magon describes his own inspiration in a similar manner:“‘Onwards!’ 
says a mysterious voice that appears, uprooting the innermost core of our being. 
It spurs on all those who are weary, spiritually burdened; whose swollen feet have 
been bled dry by the long, hard road; we who intend to rest for a while. &#x2026; ‘On¬ 
wards, onwards!’ the voice orders us .’’Similarly, Flores Magon asserts his prophetic 
role in human history in the essay,“Utopians”:“Nevertheless, at all times, the prog- 
</p>


<p>
1 6 ★ DREAMS OF FREEDOM 
</p>





<p>
ress of humanity is indebted to the dreamers and the Utopians. This thing called 
civilization: what is it if not the result of utopian efforts?The visionaries, the poets, 
the dreamers, the Utopians, so disdained by ‘serious’ people, so persecuted by 
the ‘paternalism’ of governments: lynched here, shot down there, burnt to death, 
tortured, imprisoned, torn to pieces in all epochs and all countries, nevertheless, 
have been the engines of all movements forward, the prophets who have pointed 
the blind masses towards luminous paths leading to glorious summits.” 
</p>

<p>
Those who knew or observed Ricardo Flores Magon attested to his spiri¬ 
tual force.Their descriptions of him tend not to focus on his personal qualities, 
but rather on his ability to beckon others to the struggle for human liberation. 
On hearing of his death, Flores Magon’s old Liberal Party comrade, Antonio Diaz 
Soto y Gama, eulogized him by saying, “he was the inspiration, the clear vision 
that impelled the people to revolution &#x2026; Ricardo Flores Magon saw the Revolu¬ 
tion totally, integrally, with the vision of a prophet.” Similarly, Flores Magon’s clos¬ 
est comrade for over half his life, Librado Rivera, praised him because, “his great 
steadfastness and heroic courage even transformed a people enslaved, downtrod¬ 
den, and humiliated by the greatest of despots into a proud, valiant, and respected 
people, resplendently uplifting faces imbued with terror and horror towards their 
exploiters and torturers. Indeed, Ricardo Flores Magon was the soul of that great 
libertarian epic who, in the manner of Prometheus of mythological legend, in¬ 
fused that divine fire that impelled the people to rebellion; rebellion, the creative 
well of all liberties.” Even Thomas Furlong, the detective who made a career out 
of pursuing Flores Magon and other members of the Partido Liberal Mexicano, 
described him in spiritual terms. In his 1906 report to the Mexican government, 
he stated that Flores Magon had “a very resolute and energetic character and is 
fanatical about the cause he pursues &#x2026; Ricardo is the soul of all, and without him 
the other people would do nothing.” 
</p>

<p>
As a revolutionary prophet, Ricardo Flores Magon attempted to awaken 
the enslaved masses of the world from their nightmares through a dream of so¬ 
cial, economic, and political justice.As is still the situation today, in Flores Magon’s 
time most people accepted their misery and degradation as part of the normal 
order of things. As an apostle of anarchism, Ricardo Flores Magon taught that 
misery and degradation are not natural, but rather that they are produced by the 
thievery of the rich, the manipulation of religion, and government repression. He 
taught that these three forces conspire to uphold the very basis of injustice: the 
institution of private property. 
</p>


<p>
INTRODUCTORY NOTES ^17 
</p>




<p>
Indeed, one can look at the history of Mexico as one example, among 
countless others, of how private property rights have enslaved millions. In 1511, 
Fernando Cortes and his conquistadors invaded Central America, irrevocably dis¬ 
rupting the life of the populace; they declared the land to be the property of 
Spain and subjected the natives to foreign domination and exploitation. Although 
Mexico eventually cast off the Spanish yoke, a tiny but powerful minority within 
the country continued to steal the land from beneath the feet of the people. Even 
after what would now be called “national liberation,” plantation owners seized the 
ejidos, native communal holdings, as their personal property, forcing the masses 
who had lived on them into perpetual debt slavery. Other natural resources met 
nearly the same fate, though in the cases of oil and minerals they often passed into 
the hands of foreign capitalists and corporations. 
</p>

<p>
In contrast to this wallowing at the trough, this pushing aside and tram¬ 
pling of the weak by the cunning, ruthless, and dishonest, Ricardo Flores Magon 
proposed economic, social, and political equality. Not an enforced “equality” in 
which the naturally gifted are beaten down, but an equality of opportunity, an 
equality of access to the world s wealth, an equality of access to Land and Lib¬ 
erty. 
</p>

<p>
In almost all of Ricardo Flores Magon’s writings, one can detect an un¬ 
derlying current of empathy for the downtrodden, empathy for those called The 
Other by the philosopher Emmanuel Levinas. Indeed, this is the mark of the man: 
Ricardo Flores Magon keenly felt the suffering of others, and he dedicated his life 
to alleviating it. He dedicated his life to inspiring others to cast off their chains 
by denouncing the horrors the Mexican people were subjected to by what he 
referred to as the “three-headed hydra”: capitalism, the state, and the clergy. But 
he went further and offered a vision of a much brighter tomorrow, a libertarian, 
achievable vision—if the people would but seize it. 
</p>

<p>
His libertarian, humanistic, empathetic vision is Ricardo Flores Magon’s 
legacy. A scene in a recent film, 1 “The Fourth World War,” profoundly explores this 
idea of empathy as a call to justice. In it, an Argentine grandmother passionately 
denounces the government that has so savagely murdered so many young politi¬ 
cal dissidents. She says,“We must fight so that more children do not die. It cannot 
be a thing of pity. It cannot be that, in this country, 100 children die every day.We 
can not allow it. We must participate in the struggles. Each of us must feel, at last, 
that I am the other’. I am ‘the other’. I am ‘the other’. I am the unemployed worker. 
I am the revolutionary. I am those who take over the factory. I am those who do 
not eat. I am all of us.”At the end of the film, the Zapatista, Subcomandante Marcos

<p>
likewise urges, “Listen to the word of the other. You shall no longer be you; now 
you are us.” 
</p>

<p>
A man may die, yet his noble ideals shall live on in the minds and hearts 
of others. Even though Ricardo Flores Magon, the apostle of anarchism, was mar¬ 
tyred for his prophecy, he spread his dreams of freedom through his writing and 
his actions. Across the infinity of time, hope shall spring eternally from his words 
and his life.

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND 
</p>

<p>
[by M.V.J 
</p>

<p>
MIGUEL HIDALGO AND THE WAR FOR INDEPENDENCE 
</p>

<p>
In order to comprehend Ricardo Flores Magon’s anarchist vision of so¬ 
cial and economic justice, one must understand the struggle for liberalism that 
preceded him in 19th-century Mexico.The Spanish conquest of Mexico in 1519 
brought extraordinary misery to the native population: it subjugated them po¬ 
litically to the Spanish king, dominated them spiritually via the Catholic religion, 
and enslaved them economically on the Spanish plantations. In the early 1800s, 
dissidents began to receive books bearing the European libertarian ideas that had 
inspired revolutions in France and the United States. Posing as a literary club, a 
group in Dolores, Mexico began to plot the nation’s independence from Spanish 
rule.This group included the radical parish priest Miguel Hidalgo. Before the club 
could inaugurate its uprising planned for December 8, 1810, Spanish colonial 
authorities discovered the plot and arrested several members on September 13. 
Three days later, Hidalgo received news of this capture. 
</p>

<p>
Fearing that authorities might soon descend upon him as well, Hidalgo 
rang his church’s bells early on the morning of September 16, 1810, summon¬ 
ing his parishioners to mass. He confronted them with the words that are now 
famously remembered as El Grito de Dolores (“The Cry of Dolores”): “Will you 
free yourselves? Will you recover the lands stolen three hundred years ago from 
your forefathers by the hated Spaniards?” 1 The congregation responded enthu¬ 
siastically, and Hidalgo led them toward San Miguel. Hundreds more Mexican pa¬ 
triots joined them on their march. Over the course of its struggle, the rebel army 
swelled to several thousand. In San Miguel, Guanajuato, and other towns, the im¬ 
poverished masses following Hidalgo rioted, burning and pillaging the homes, 
businesses, and political edifices of the privileged Spanish oppressors. Worried 
about his followers’ uncontrollable rage, Hidalgo decided not to attack Mexico 
City. It was a bad decision. Hidalgo’s elitist distrust of the popular will caused 
many brave Indians to abandon his struggle. His hesitation also gave the govern¬ 
ment an opportunity to organize its military force and quash the uprising. As a 
result of Hidalgo’s indecision, the War for Independence raged on for another 
eleven years. 
</p>

<p>
Hidalgo ultimately met defeat on the fighting fields of Guadalajara. Dur¬ 
ing the battle, a Spanish artillery shell hit the rebel army’s munitions wagon. Fires 
spread quickly in the tall, dry grass surrounding the revolutionaries, impelling

<p>
them to flee. Hidalgo was captured shortly afterwards and executed by firing 
squad. As a warning against other revolutionary attempts, his head was impaled 
upon a pole in the middle of Guanajuato. Yet, the popular will that had awoken so 
furiously on the morning of September 16,1810 could not so easily be put back 
to rest. Under the leadership of Jose Maria Morelos, Vicente Guerrero, Guadal¬ 
upe Victoria, and others, the insurgents continued fighting valorously. Finally, on 
February 24, 1821, the Spanish Colonel Augustin de Iturbide met with the rebel 
leader Vicente Guerrero, agreeing to the Plan de Iguala that asserted Mexico’s 
independence from Spain. 
</p>

<p>
Even though this document established autonomy for the nation of 
Mexico, it preserved the structures that had subjugated the people of Mexico 
since the Spanish conquest. It organized the country politically as a monarchy. 
The Catholic Church still maintained its authority over the people’s spiritual life. 
Socially, the Plan de Iguala benefited only those who were already near the top 
of the ladder: the criollos. For the first time in history, criollos, white Mexicans 
directly descended from pure European ancestry, would be granted the same 
rights as gachupines, Spaniards living in Mexico. In contrast, the indigenous and 
mestizo (mixed race) populations would be relegated to the same misery they 
had endured for three centuries.

BENITO JUAREZ AND THE STRUGGLE FOR REFORM 
</p>

<p>
For the next 35 years, Mexico continued to suffer under a succession of 
emperors, monarchs, and military tyrants. Although the rebel leader Vicente Guer¬ 
rero briefly became president and abolished slavery, he was soon overthrown by 
his vice-president, Anastasio Bustamante, who was in turn toppled by General 
Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna. Against the popular will for liberation, Santa Anna 
centralized power under himself and promoted the dominance of the Catho¬ 
lic Church. Further, he sold Mexico’s natural resources—its precious mines—to 
foreign investors, making himself a millionaire. Although he defended Mexico 
against an invasion by the French, he lost the territory that is now California, 
Texas, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, and Arizona to the United States, when the U.S. 
government, pursuing its policy of Manifest Destiny, invaded Mexico and seized 
half its territory in 1846-1847. 
</p>

<p>
In the 1850s, a new group of revolutionaries began to plot the overthrow 
of Santa Anna’s military dictatorship. Like their predecessors, they read widely 
from classic liberal thinkers such as Voltaire and Rousseau. In addition, they stud¬ 
ied newer libertarians, such as the anarchist Pierre Joseph Proudhon. The inspi¬ 
rational leader of this group was Benito Juarez, an Indian from the state of Oax-

<p>
aca who, after being orphaned at a young age, walked to Oaxaca City, where he 
worked and studied law. He donated his legal services to the impoverished, largely 
indigenous masses of Mexico. After defending many poor villagers without much 
success, Juarez realized that improving their lives required political engagement. 
He served in various government posts, including governor of Oaxaca. Still frus¬ 
trated by the lack of progress, Juarez and his supporters issued the Plan de Ayutla 
and fomented a revolution against Santa Anna, driving him from the country. 
</p>

<p>
The movement inaugurated by Juarez and his liberal cohorts, known in 
Mexico as The Reform, profoundly changed the country by wresting power away 
from traditional sources of authority. The Ley Juarez required members of the 
church and the military to stand trial in civil courts for civil offenses. The Ley 
Lerdo required ecclesiastical and civic institutions to forfeit property they did not 
need for their daily functioning. Unfortunately, the law considered ejidos, the tradi¬ 
tional communal lands of native Mexicans, to be civil corporations. In the end, this 
resulted in many villagers being forced to sell their homes and lands to the rich 
and the politically powerful. The Constitution of 1857, incorporating these two 
laws, further constrained the power of the Church and established a wide range 
of liberal legal protections for the Mexican people. It included a bill of inalienable 
rights that prescribed such fundamental liberties as the freedoms of press, speech, 
and assembly. After a long, hard military struggle against the conservatives, the 
liberals emerged victorious in 1861 and elected Juarez to the presidency. 
</p>

<p>
Not long after the liberals attained power, however, French armies invad¬ 
ed Mexico. Emperor Napoleon III had committed himself to extending his empire 
throughout the world. Not only did he desire to expand his imperial territory, he 
also wanted Mexico to repay its debts and he wished to reassert the Church’s 
influence over its peopie.The Mexican army repelled the Napoleon’s invasion on 
May 5, 1862 in a battle now commemorated in Mexico as the holiday Cinco de 
Mayo.The brilliant maneuvering of the young Oaxacan brigadier general Porfirio 
Diaz was primarily responsible for this victory. Nevertheless, the French returned 
to conquer Mexico and installed the Austrian archduke, Ferdinand Maximillian 
of Hapsburg, as emperor. Although Maximillian was not a particularly tyrannical 
ruler, liberals resented the foreign domination. In reaction, Juarez and his support¬ 
ers led a revolt against Maximillian and ultimately regained control of Mexico in 
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li></li>
</ol>

<p>
As before, Juarez was elected to rule over the process of reform, and 
implemented changes to improve the lives of the Mexican people. As one who 
had risen to prominence through his learning, Juarez placed the utmost empha- 
</p>


<p>

</p>




<p>
sis on improving education. To dispute the Catholic Church’s monopoly of the 
schools, Juarez commissioned Gabino Barreda to design a curriculum inspired 
by the positivist philosophy of Auguste Comte. This would replace belief in God 
with an emphasis on science. Even more important for Juarez, the law made pri¬ 
mary education free and compulsory for all Mexican children. It also mandated 
the building of schools throughout the country. 
</p>

<p>
Along with positivism, anarchist philosophy began to influence Mexican 
social movements during this period. One of the leaders of the Reform, Melchor 
Ocampo, became enthralled by the thought of the French anarchist Pierre Joseph 
Proudhon while he was traveling in Europe in the 1840s. He translated many of 
Proudhon’s works into Spanish and published them in Mexico City. Although 
Ocampo’s desire to divide large plantations into small peasant proprietorships 
was probably influenced by Proudhon, he did not seriously question the funda¬ 
mental basis of government as a true anarchist would. Nevertheless, through the 
efforts of various educators and activists, anarchism became the leading ideology 
of Mexican radicals for many years. 
</p>

<p>
Like Ocampo, the Greek-born scholar Plotino Rhodakanaty was also 
deeply affected by the writings of Proudhon. While studying medicine in Berlin 
in 1850, he traveled to Paris to meet the great anarchist thinker. In 1861, Rhoda¬ 
kanaty moved to Mexico City intending to set up a utopian socialist system of 
agrarian communes. In 1863, he formed a small study group to discuss libertarian 
socialist thought with students such as Francisco Zalacosta and Santiago Villan¬ 
ueva .These disciples helped deliver anarchist ideas to both agrarian peasants and 
industrial proletarians, inspiring movements in villages and cities. 
</p>

<p>
Rhodakanaty and Zalacosta founded and directed a school in Chaleo, a 
town near Mexico City. There, they inspired a young student, Julio Chavez Lopez. 
In response to this libertarian teaching, Chavez Lopez led a series of agrarian 
insurgencies in 1868-9, raiding various plantations and redistributing the land to 
the local peasantry. 
</p>

<p>
Although peasant uprisings had occurred throughout Mexico ever since 
the Spanish conquest, Chavez Lopez’s movement was the first that consciously 
articulated an ideology. Ever loyal to his anarchist ideals, he issued a manifesto 
on April 20, 1869 that specifically indicted the exploitation of landowners, the 
indoctrination of the church, and the repression of the government for causing 
the misery of the peasants. Chavez Lopez’s movement grew to over 1500 par¬ 
tisans, and inspired uprisings in various Mexican states. However, after he was 
captured in his hideout, he was executed by federal troops on September 1,1869. 
</p>


<p>

<p>
He cried out “Long live socialism” as the firing squad discharged its fatal bullets. 
Even though the peasant movement lost a great leader with Chavez Lopez’s death, 
uprisings continued throughout Mexico. The ideology he propounded and the 
movements he started ultimately influenced Emiliano Zapata s agrarian program 
of expropriating haciendas (plantations) during the Mexican Revolution of 1910- 
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">

</ol>

<p>
While Francisco Zalacosta spread anarchist ideals among the rural popu¬ 
lation of Mexico, Santiago Villanueva and other activists organized industrial work¬ 
ers along anarchist-collectivist lines and spread their radicalism through a variety 
of labor organizations and newspapers. In 1865, Villanueva helped organize tex¬ 
tile workers in Mexico City and Tlalnepantla who fought the first labor struggles 
in Mexican history. Although these protests were brutally repressed, Villanueva 
helped to organize another textile strike three years later in nearby Tlalpan that 
won better working conditions and shorter hours for female laborers. 3 As with 
the agrarian spokesmen, Villanueva and other radical labor activists passionately 
advocated anarchist-collectivism, repudiating the malign impact of capitalism and 
government. These union movements, like the peasant movements, greatly af¬ 
fected the Mexican Revolution, influencing the formation of the Casa del Obrero 
Mundial, an explicitly anarcho-syndicalist labor federation, in 1912. 
</p>

<p>
THE DICTATORSHIP OF PORFIRIO DIAZ 
</p>

<p>
Although Juarez did much to liberalize Mexico and to improve the lives of 
its campcsinos, his repeated reelections provoked opposition from Porfirio Diaz, 
the military officer who had repulsed the French Invasion on Cinco de Mayo and 
who ran unsuccessfully against Juarez the second time Juarez was reelected in 
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>After serving his third presidential term, Juarez decided to run for a fourth</li>
</ol>
<p>
in 1871. Two candidates opposed him: Sebastian Lerdo de Tejada, the brother of 
the man who had authored the Ley Lerdo, and Porfirio Diaz.The election did not 
produce a clear majority for any of the candidates. Following the Mexican con¬ 
stitution, the Congress cast ballots to appoint their new leaders, electing Juarez 
as president of the nation and Lerdo as the president of the Supreme Court. In 
reaction, an embittered Diaz issued his Plan de Nona, which lashed out at the 
principle of reelection and specifically against the ascent of Juarez to a fourth 
term. Following his military instincts, Diaz subsequently led a coup against the 
government that federal troops quickly crushed. 
</p>

<p>
Undeterred, Diaz continued to plot. On July 18, 1872, Juarez died of a 
heart attack, and Lerdo succeeded him to the presidency. When Lerdo ran for

</p>




<p>
re-election in the presidential campaign of 1876, Diaz issued his Plan deTuxte- 
pec, criticizing Lerdo for a variety of alleged misdeeds, and again promoting the 
principles of “no reelection” and “free suffrage.”As before, Diaz led a military coup 
against the government. By this time, he had amassed enough ammunition and 
manpower to defeat the federal forces of President Lerdo, who had alienated 
many of Juarez’s supporters. Diaz’s victory established him as the military dicta¬ 
tor of Mexico—a position he would hold for the next thirty-five years, but for one 
hiatus. As he had rallied forces under a banner of “no reelection,” Diaz stepped 
aside in 1880 to allow his lackey, Manuel Gonzalez, to rule for four years. After 
Gonzalez changed the constitution to allow for reelection, Diaz maintained his 
iron grip over Mexico until the Revolution of 1910. 
</p>

<p>
The notoriously corrupt Diaz tyranny combined the brutality of military 
barbarism with the exploitation of capitalism, bringing tremendous suffering to 
the Mexican people. Diaz ruled by the principle of pan o palo, the bread or the 
stick. Noting that a dog with a bone in his mouth does not bite or steal, Diaz lav¬ 
ished favors upon his political friends and neutralized his political enemies with 
bribes, kickbacks, land concessions, and sweetheart contracts. He was particularly 
concerned with subduing the ambitions of military officers who could mount a 
coup against him, as he had against Juarez. Powerful army figures received large 
land grants and tended to dominate government posts.Those who were not pla¬ 
cated by these gifts were routinely assassinated. 
</p>

<p>
Many of the gifts the dictator doled out to friends and potential rivals 
were political appointments. Under his autocratic rule, Diaz created a feudal sys¬ 
tem of governors Jefespoliticos (district political bosses), and mayors. He manip¬ 
ulated elections, circulating lists to his underlings of future appointments. These 
officials made sure Diaz’s candidates won political offices. A few times, the tyrant 
made the mistake of including on these lists names of candidates who had died. 
Other times, he made sure that particular opposition candidates joined the de¬ 
ceased before an election could take place. 
</p>

<p>
Diaz’s primary concern in establishing this hierarchy was to ensure that 
none of his political rivals could grow powerful enough to challenge him. He 
skillfully manipulated officials against each other, so that they would be too busy 
with their internal statewide or interstate struggles to confront his federal au¬ 
thority. As the dictator only attended to threats to his own national position, he 
cared little about how his subordinates lorded over their local domains. Many 
oppressed and exploited their subjects with regimes far more murderous and 
thieving than even that of Diaz. Governors and political bosses routinely used 
</p>


<p>

</p>




<p>
their power to enrich themselves, seizing natural resources and selling them off 
to foreign investors. For example, Enrique Creel, the governor of Chihuahua, per¬ 
sonally owned almost two million acres of land, and directed the most influential 
bank in the state. His clan, the Terrazas-Creel family, owed 70 million acres and 
controlled many industries, including mines, steel and iron mills, sugar refineries, 
breweries, granaries, meat packing plants, telephone companies, and railroads. 
</p>

<p>
In this feudal dictatorship, all shreds of political justice were sacrificed 
to preserve the authoritarian order. The people of Mexico were subjected to the 
whims of the landowners, industrial bosses, and government officials. The local 
overlords had unrestrained license to murder male subjects and to rape the fe¬ 
males. 1 Just as Diaz controlled the elections of local leaders and legislative repre¬ 
sentatives, he and his underlings directly appointed most of the judges through¬ 
out Mexico.To promote the economic and political interests of the regime, they 
routinely rendered verdicts that protected the interests of foreigners and wealthy, 
prominent Mexicans. Peasants and proletarians rarely found justice in the courts. 
</p>

<p>
The verdicts of the courts and the mandates of the rich and powerful 
were enforced by the police, the army, and the rurales that terrorized the dis¬ 
enfranchised. The rurales were bandits recruited by Diaz to control the rural 
population; as police officers, they had free reign to subject villagers to their dep¬ 
redations.The ranks of the Mexican army consisted mostly of humble people who 
were forcibly conscripted into its ranks. However, the government professional¬ 
ized the military and spent one-quarter of its budget to maintain it, spending every 
resource to train the soldiers or to intimidate them into following the dictator’s 
ruthless orders. 
</p>

<p>
The Diaz regime routinely ignored the most basic human and political 
rights.The Ley ruga (Fugitive Law) aiiowed police to execute citizens freely with 
the excuse that their victims were trying to flee from prosecution. Opponents of 
the dictator and those who challenged the whims of their local overlords were 
frequently assassinated. Uprisings, protests, and strikes were drowned in blood. 
Officials rarely enforced and regularly violated the mandates of the 1857 Con¬ 
stitution. The Catholic Church had free reign in the country, reappropriating its 
property and extorting money from the peasants. Additionally, the government 
routinely silenced voices of dissent by suppressing opposition newspapers. Diaz’s 
lackey Manuel Gonzalez reversed the constitutional order that had guaranteed 
journalists and newspapers the right to a jury trial, forcing them to accept the 
decisions of judges appointed by the dictator. As a result, Filomena Mata, the pub-

<p>

</p>




<p>
lisher of the opposition journal El Diario del Hogar, received prison sentences 
34 separate times for criticizing the government. 
</p>

<p>
The dictatorship subjected the indigenous masses to the same spiritual 
degradation that they had suffered under the Spanish. Although Diaz came from 
a humble, mostly native family, he was determined to fit into the European high 
society that had dominated the nation since its conquest by Cortes. Indeed, when 
one compares pictures of the tyrant over the course of his rule, it appears that 
his skin and his hair get lighter, and his features more continental. His wife Car¬ 
men Rubio not only taught him the social graces that would endear this primitive 
warrior chieftain to aristocratic society, but also encouraged him to embrace the 
Catholic Church. Under her influence, Diaz ignored the laws of reform. In return, 
the church dutifully preached submission to the dictator. 
</p>

<p>
As the regime became a modern bureaucratic-capitalist state, it advanced 
an ideology that complemented the Catholicism that had promoted feudal hier¬ 
archy for so long. Diaz assembled around him a cabinet of advisors who called 
themselves cientificos, or scientists. They supplemented the authoritarianism of 
Church ideology by justifying the oppression of the masses in scientific terms. 
They explained Mexico’s social inequality as a function of Darwin’s theory of 
the survival of the fittest. According to these so-called scientists, the Indian and 
mixed-blood population of Mexico consisted of a primitive and brutal race of 
men that required the rule of the more advanced Europeans to guide it. In these 
terms, this social and racial disparity between white aristocrats and the indig¬ 
enous masses seemed to be the proper consequence of natural laws. 
</p>

<p>
Emboldened by this racist ideology, Diaz allowed foreign capitalists to 
freely exploit the native masses. He seized the Indian communal lands, or ejidos, 
from peoples who had lived on them for centuries, and sold them for a pittance 
to foreign land speculators and white aristocrats within Mexico. While the seizure 
of these ejidos began under the 1856 Ley Lerdo, Diaz severely aggravated this situ¬ 
ation by eliminating all legal limits on land ownership, resulting in an extraordi¬ 
nary concentration of ownership among a small elite. By 1910, half of the nation’s 
land belonged to fewer than three thousand families.The dictator waged long and 
bloody wars against native populations that resisted this encroachment, such as 
the Maya in the Yucatan and the Yaqui in Sonora. 
</p>

<p>
As well as selling off the land of Mexico, Diaz promoted foreign capital¬ 
ists’ seizure of natural resources and industries. He lavished favors upon foreign 
investors, granting them contracts to build railroads and drainage systems, and 
giving them control over textile, coffee, tobacco, petroleum, mining, and other in- 
</p>


<p>

<p>
dustries. Along with local aristocrats, foreign capitalists owned almost everything 
of value in Mexico. United States capital alone controlled over a billion dollars’ 
worth of Mexico’s natural resources.The Arizona rancher, Colonel William Greene, 
acquired enormous mines in Sonora from the governor’s widow for only 47,000 
pesos, roughly $25,000. He exploited this national resource to become one of the 
largest copper magnates in the world. s 
</p>

<p>
This combination of brutal military rule and foreign exploitation reduced 
Mexico’s people to the most desperate misery.Their lands stolen from them, half 
of the rural population was forced to work on enormous haciendas (plantations). 
Landowners paid them the same salaries as a century before, even though infla¬ 
tion had quadrupled the prices of most basic commodities.These starvation wag¬ 
es were often even further reduced: many peons did not receive payment in ac¬ 
tual currency, but rather in script that could only be redeemed at the plantation’s 
tiencla cle raya (company store). In addition, these poor villagers had to pay rent 
to the landowner, taxes to the government, and exorbitant fees to the church for 
religious services.This extraordinary impoverishment, combined with the lack of 
decent shelter, clean water, and adequate health care, produced a high mortality 
rate among peasants. However, even death did not permit release from this system 
of exploitation. Landowners forced peasants to work long hours on fields and 
farms by keeping them in perpetual debt. When they died, this debt was passed 
on to their descendants, enslaving a new generation to the plantation. 6 Although 
the industrial laborers did not suffer the same kinds of exploitation as the rural 
peasantry, they too faced brutal conditions, working long hours for miserable sala¬ 
ries in extremely unsafe factories and mines.

RICARDO FLORES MAuGN 
</p>

<p>
EARLY DAYS IN MEXICO 
</p>

<p>
Ricardo Flores Magon was born during Porfirio Diaz’s first presidential 
term on Mexican Independence Day, September 16, 1874, in the village of San 
Antonio Eloxochitlan in the district of Teotitlan del Camino, Oaxaca. He was the 
second of three brothers, preceded by Jesus three years before, and followed by 
Enrique three years after. His father Teodoro Flores may have been a full-blooded 
Oaxacan Indian. 7 Whether he was or not, the villagers respected his position in 
their community, referring to him as “tata” (elder). He supported his family mod¬ 
estly as a farmer. He had also served for many years in the Mexican Army fighting 
for his fellow Oaxacan Benito Juarez in the War of Reform. Flores helped Juarez

<p>
beat back the French invasion under the command of another Oaxacan, Porfirio 
Diaz.When Diaz rallied patriotic Mexicans to his cry of “No Reelection” in his Plan 
ofTuxtepec, Flores unfortunately believed in Diaz’s sincerity and supported his 
grab for power. 
</p>

<p>
An idealistic, principled man,Teodoro Flores impressed upon his sons 
the nobility of Juarez’s mission to free the natives of Mexico from the oppression 
that still reigned under the Diaz dictatorship. He explained to his sons that, in 
contrast to the brutal competition of Mexico City, the villagers of Oaxaca prac¬ 
ticed a form of mutual aid. No rich and no poor existed in their communities: each 
person produced what she or he could and each took what she or he needed for 
survival. The villagers did not need judges, jails, or policemen to govern them: 
“We live with peace, respect, and love towards one another as friends and broth¬ 
ers.” 8 During Porfirio Diaz’s reign, however, local aristocrats and foreign capital¬ 
ists were quickly appropriating these effectively anarcho-communist ejidos as 
their own private property. Ricardo’s mother, Margarita Magon, a mixed-blood 
Mexican whose grandfather had emigrated from Cartagena, Spain, also fiercely 
supported the legacy of Juarez. Furthermore, she realized that Juarez became 
capable of improving the lives of himself and the Mexican people by receiving a 
good education. A strong willed woman, she moved her family to Mexico City so 
that her three sons could attend the best schools in the country. 
</p>

<p>
Ricardo Flores Magon began his struggle against tyranny while he was 
still in school. On May 16,1892, when he was only seventeen years old and in his 
final year of preparatory education, he and his two brothers participated in mass 
student demonstrations against the second re-election of Diaz. Police arrested 
Ricardo and his brother Jesus along with many others.Thanks to subsequent pro¬ 
tests denouncing the incarceration of demonstrators, Ricardo was released after a 
brief detention. However, the authorities sent Jesus to the dark, musty, spider- and 
rat-infested cells of Belen prison, a frequent destination for opponents of Diaz’s 
regime. Ricardo continued his struggle when, emulating Juarez, he entered the 
School of Jurisprudence in 1893 to train for a legal career. Here, he embarked on 
his life’s work as a journalist, founding the opposition newspaper El Democrata. 
In its pages, he criticized the plantation system that the dictator’s policies sup¬ 
ported so vigorously and that so dramatically impoverished the peasants. The 
porfiriato suppressed the paper after only three months. The government used 
a legal technicality to close it down, raiding its offices and arresting many of the 
staff. Flores Magon escaped by jumping out of a window. 
</p>


<p>
BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH ★ 31 
</p>




<p>
After these heady beginnings as a student activist, Flores Magon disap¬ 
peared from the political scene for several years. He seems to have gone into 
hiding—or at least to have curbed his dissident activities—for the remainder of 
the nineteenth century His father passed away in 1893. Some scholars believe that 
Flores Magon avoided political activity during the following years so that he could 
focus on earning money to provide for his mother. 9 Apparently, he spent some of 
these years working for a liberal lawyer in Pachuca, Hidalgo, 10 and perhaps as a 
bookkeeper in a Oaxacan town near his birthplace. 11 
</p>

<p>
REGENERACI6N AND THE LIBERAL PARTY 
</p>

<p>
Ricardo Flores Magon returned to the political struggle in 1900, writing for the 
journal with which he would be identified for the rest of his life. On August 7, 
1900, he, along with his brother Jesus and Antonio Horcasitas,both recent gradu¬ 
ates of law school, founded the newspaper Regeneration. Declaring itself to be 
a “ Peri6)dico Jurtdico Independiente ” (“Independent Juridical Journal”), the pa¬ 
per focused on exposing miscarriages of justice, violations of rights guaranteed 
by the constitution, and corruption in courts under the porfiriato. Although its 
tone was basically reformist rather than revolutionary, criticism of the judiciary 
ultimately constituted attacks on Diaz and his underlings. They responded with 
typical repression. Horcasitas resigned from the staff after authorities jailed him 
for an article he had written. 
</p>

<p>
When Ricardo Flores Magon assumed many of Horcasitas’ duties, Regen¬ 
eration became more militant. Beginning with its December 31,1900 issue, it as¬ 
sumed the motto “ Periodico Independiente de Combate ” (“Independent Journal 
of Combat”). Now the paper attacked the regime directly, criticizing corruption 
among specific governors and cabinet members. It also discussed atrocities such 
as slavery in Sonora and the Yucatan. Although it dared to confront political injus¬ 
tices more stridently, the paper remained ambivalent about revolution. In certain 
articles, it proclaimed its desire for true democracy, claiming that it is only a dicta¬ 
tor, not the masses, who foments a revolution. However, other articles celebrated 
the legacy of the Jacobins, the most radical leaders of the French revolution, as 
well as that of Miguel Hidalgo, whose Grito de Dolores initiated Mexico’s struggle 
for independence against the Spanish. 
</p>

<p>
Soon after Regeneracion appeared, the wealthy engineer and occasional 
politician Camilo Arriaga issued a statement calling for the formation of a liberal 
party. Arriaga was the nephew of one of the framers of the liberal Constitution 
of 1857 that, among other things, wrested power away from the Catholic Church. 
</p>


<p>
32 ★ DREAMS OF FREEDOM 
</p>




<p>
Diaz, under the influence of his devout wife and other conservative aristocratic 
interests, did not enforce any of these provisions. 
</p>

<p>
Arriaga’s call for a liberal party was largely a reaction to a statement 
made by his local bishop. While returning from a trip to the Vatican, the priest 
bragged to a Paris newspaper that Diaz allowed the church to carry out its activi¬ 
ties unimpeded and that it would soon control Mexico. 12 The infuriated engineer, 
Arriaga, demanded that Mexico return to Juarez’s legacy and enforce the civil 
rights guarantees and the anti-clerical provisions of its constitution. In response 
to this call, liberal clubs sprang up throughout the nation. On the anniversary of 
the constitution, February 5,1901, the Liberal Party held its first congress to dis¬ 
cuss reforms. Army officers patrolled the streets outside the meeting hall. Fifty-six 
delegates from 50 different clubs attended. Ricardo Flores Magon was invited to 
represent a liberal student group and also acted as an emissary of his dissident 
newspaper. At this conference Flores Magon met many of the people who would 
work with and support him in the future, such as Librado Rivera,Juan Sarabia, and 
Antonio Diaz Soto y Gama. 
</p>

<p>
The congress began with Diodoro Batalla citing the individualist anar¬ 
chist Max Stirner: “Tyrants appear great because we come to them on our knees. 
Let us rise!” 13 Most of the speeches, however, critiqued only the misdeeds of 
the church, a relatively safe and indirect condemnation of the government. In 
contrast, Flores Magon gave a fiery speech detailing the evils of the dictator’s 
regime, concluding with “the administration of Porfirio Diaz is a den of thieves.” 
The shocked, timid representatives hissed his speech, yet Flores Magon bravely 
repeated himself. After the audience received him with more hisses and nervous 
murmuring, he again repeated, “Yes gentlemen, the administration of Porfirio Diaz 
is a den of thieves .’’After this third declaration, that many delegates knew in their 
hearts to be true, the buzzing transformed into a round of applause. 14 
</p>

<p>
Soon after the conference ,Regeneration became an important outlet for 
the Liberal Party, publishing its manifestoes and spreading its message through 
its pages. It glorified Juarez and the constitution. It promoted classical liberal val¬ 
ues such as freedom of the press, detailing Diaz’s frequent attacks on dissident 
voices. Regeneration demanded that neither should Diaz run for re-election nor 
should he manipulate one of his underlings into his office as he had in 1880 
with Manuel Gonzalez. Instead, it declared, a Liberal should be elected as the 
next president. Along with these political statements ,Regeneration continued to 
condemn various administrators, judges, and representatives in the government. 
It also drew attention to social and economic issues, criticizing exploitation by 
</p>


<p>

<p>
U.S. capitalists, detailing the abuses of plantation owners, and supporting a strike 
among carriage drivers. 
</p>

<p>
The paper’s outspoken stances soon earned it official retribution. On May 
23, 1901, Ricardo and Jesus Flores Magon were arrested for an article discussing 
kickbacks in a road construction project. This piece allegedly defamed the char¬ 
acter of a Oaxacan political boss. While the two brothers languished in Belen 
prison for over eleven months, their youngest brother Enrique assumed the re¬ 
sponsibility of publishing Regeneration. From jail, Jesus and Ricardo continued 
to write stories for the paper, including one criticizing their own imprisonment. 
The authorities finally shut down the press on October 7. During their imprison¬ 
ment, the beloved mother of the two dissidents, Margarita Magon, passed away. 
Reportedly, cientifico government officials offered to grant her sons freedom if 
she would convince them to give up their struggle. As strong willed as ever, she 
replied that she would rather die alone than make her sons back down. 15 Years 
later, Ricardo Flores Magon wrote of his profound regret that “I could not be at her 
bedside: I could not give her a last kiss nor could I hear her last words.” 16 
</p>

<p>
Throughout Mexico, Diaz attacked the growing opposition. Federal and 
state police swept through liberal clubs in every part of the nation, closing them 
down and imprisoning their leadership. Antonio Diaz Soto y Gama was arrested 
for a fiery speech opposing the dictator that he delivered in commemoration 
of Benito Juarez. 17 Similarly, Diaz suppressed various dissident journals, including 
Filomena Mata’s El Diario del Hogar, whose press had printed Regeneration's 
allegedly libelous article.Yet the liberals continued to organize clubs and publish 
newspapers. In November 1901, Camilo Arriaga issued a call for a second party 
congress on the next anniversary of the constitution, February 5, 1902. However, 
on January 24 soldiers invaded a planning meeting tor the convention, arresting 
important leaders such as Arriaga, Juan Sarabia, and Librado Rivera. 18

EL HIJODELAHUIZOTE 
</p>

<p>
When Ricardo and Jesus Flores Magon emerged from Belen on April 30, 
1902, they took diverging paths. An exhausted Jesus left the movement, retiring 
to pursue his legal career; he set up a law office and married Clara Hong, his fian¬ 
cee of 11 years. In his stead, the youngest Flores Magon brother, Enrique, joined 
Ricardo to continue the fight against the dictatorship.Together, the two brothers 
took over ElHijo delAhuizote, a paper best known for artist Jesus Martinez Car¬ 
rion’s brilliant caricatures that ridiculed government officials. They soon landed 
in trouble again. After publishing a critical article about General Bernardo Reyes, 
</p>

</p>




<p>
sometimes governor of Nuevo Leon, Diaz’s Minister of War, and his possible suc¬ 
cessor to the presidency, Ricardo and Enrique were arrested on the orders of a 
military judge. The paper was closed down. Even though Ricardo testified that 
the elderly editor of El Hijo delAhuizote, Daniel Cabrera, had no control over the 
journal anymore, Cabrera was also taken in. Enrique and Ricardo languished in 
prisons, first military and then civil,until the end of January 1903. 
</p>

<p>
Despite this repression, the liberals were by no means defeated. As vari¬ 
ous leaders emerged from jail, they recommenced the publication of opposition 
newspapers and the formation of liberal clubs. Juan Sarabia and Antonio Diaz Soto 
y Gama, then Camilo Arriaga, then the Flores Magon brothers revived El Hijo del 
Ahuizote several times as it was repressed again and again by the government. On 
the anniversary of the constitution, February 5,1903, the editors draped a banner 
from the balcony of the newspaper’s office boldly pronouncing “LA CONSTITU- 
CION HA MUERTO” (“THE CONSTITUTION HAS DIED”). 19 As Ricardo Flores 
Magon explained in the next issue of the paper, the tyrant Diaz had prostituted 
the cause of justice and had subjected the Mexican people to the domination of 
the church, murdering the great liberal document of 1857. On April 2, a holiday 
commemorating one of Diaz’s victories against the French, Ricardo and Enrique, 
along with the liberal Club Redencion, marched to the dictator’s palace carry¬ 
ing signs proclaiming “No reelection.” Only the crowds around them saved them 
from execution. Soon after this demonstration, El Hijo del Ahuizote also publi¬ 
cized General Bernardo Reyes’ bloody suppression of a rally in support of his 
challenger for Nuevo Leon governor. 
</p>

<p>
In the wake of all this, the dictatorship took drastic measures to silence 
the persistent dissident voices of Ricardo Flores Magon and the Liberal Party. On 
April 16, police invaded the offices of El Hijo delAhuizote and arrested the staff, 
including the Flores Magon brothers, Juan Sarabia, and Librado Rivera. Courts ac¬ 
cused them of criticizing officials for fulfilling their duties.They were again sent 
to Belen, this time for a month and a half .The final blow, however, came shortly af¬ 
ter they were released from prison. On June 9, Mexico City courts decreed—and 
the Supreme Court later ratified the decision—that it would be illegal for any 
periodical to carry anything written by either Flores Magon brother.

</p>


<p>
Even though the Mexican Supreme Court forbade the Flores Magons 
from writing articles of dissent, the brothers refused to halt their revolutionary 
mission. Unable to pursue their vocation in their native country, Ricardo, along 
with his brother Enrique, fled to the United States, never to return to Mexico dur¬ 
ing his lifetime.They arrived virtually penniless in Laredo,Texas in January 1904. 
The brothers’ trip to Laredo was funded by Camilo Arriaga who had fled to El Paso, 
Texas along with Antonio Diaz Soto y Gama shortly before the final raid of El Hijo 
delAhuizote. Other liberals fleeing from the dictatorship, such as Juan Sarabia and 
his cousin Manuel, soon joined them. Ricardo Flores Magon hoped to set up dis¬ 
sident newspapers in New York City and along the Mexico-U.S. border to foment 
the inevitable revolution. Although he never made it to the East Coast, he was able 
to set up an impressive network of revolutionary cells that in the coming years 
incited several unsuccessful uprisings against Diaz. 
</p>

<p>
As soon as they arrived in Texas, the Flores Magons immediately began 
organizing to resume publication of Regeneracion.They took jobs as farm labor¬ 
ers and dishwashers, 20 surviving off the vegetables they could bring back from 
harvests. Ever a vigorous writer, Ricardo sent letters to liberals throughout Mexico 
asking for money and requesting that readers solicit friends to contribute and 
provide leads to other potential supporters. Liberals in Mexico, such as Ricardo’s 
brother, the lawyer Jesus Flores Magon, helped raise money. El Colmillo Publico 
(“The Public Eyetooth”), the Mexico City liberal newspaper that cartoonist Jesus 
Martinez Carrion founded after the suppression of El Hijo delAhuizote , advertised 
their efforts in its pages. Wealthy liberals such as Arriaga and Francisco I. Madero, 
the wealthy landowner who would ultimately topple the porfiriato , also contrib¬ 
uted substantial funds. After some initial setbacks, the liberals finally moved to San 
Antonio and bought a press. 
</p>

<p>
Regeneracion resumed publication on November 5, 1904. In its first is¬ 
sue, it introduced itself with a long history of the persecution of the press and 
the Liberal Party in Mexico. The editors explained their reasons for moving to 
the United States, vowing to struggle for political change in Mexico. The paper 
resumed its criticism of Porfirio Diaz and his vice president Ramon Corral. It also 
broadly criticized the social and economic injustices of the nation, citing exploita¬ 
tion by foreign capital, debt slavery on plantations, and oppression of poor work¬ 
ers in the cities. 
</p>

<p>
SAINT LOUIS, MISSOURI 
</p>

<p>
Even though they had exiled themselves to the United States, the Flores 
Magons’ efforts soon attracted the repression of the Mexican government. The 
local consulate maintained its surveillance upon them. In December 1904, a Mexi¬ 
can agent entered their residence and attempted to stab Ricardo in the back. 
Luckily, Enrique was standing nearby and wrestled the attacker to the ground.The 
police, however were conveniently stationed outside. They arrested and fined 
Enrique for disturbing the peace, allowing the assailant to go free. Worried by this 
attack, the brothers decided to move farther from the border. 
</p>

<p>
Through Camilo Arriaga, they contacted Francisco I. Madero, who con¬ 
tributed $2000 for the liberals’ trip to the heart of the United States: Saint Louis, 
Missouri.Juan Sarabia and Ricardo Flores Magon arrived on February 2,1905, and 
others followed soon after. Regeneration was published again from Saint Louis 
beginning on February 27, eventually acquiring 30,000 subscribers. As before, 
the paper was widely distributed in border towns in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, 
and California. It was smuggled into Mexico through a variety of means, such as 
by sending copies within hollo wed-out Sears catalogues. Railroad workers and 
other volunteers aided in this effort. The publishers solicited additional subscrib¬ 
ers through lists of names submitted by current readers. Publication agents and 
newsstands distributed the paper in their local communities. As before, Regen¬ 
eration attacked prominent people in the Diaz administration such as General 
Bernardo Reyes and the cientifico financial minister Jose Ives Limantour. Aware 
of its new situation in a new country, the paper also encouraged people to send 
in reports about exploitation by local officials, judges, and Masonic lodges. 
</p>

<p>
In Saint Louis, Ricardo contacted the local anarchist and socialist commu¬ 
nity, mostly composed of refugees from Russia and Germany. Here, he may have 
first met the most prominent anarchist of the age, Emma Goldman, a dissident 
who had fled from czarist Russia. 21 Even if this encounter did occur, it may not 
have had much impact, because Ricardo was not yet fluent in English, and Gold¬ 
man didn’t speak Spanish. Ricardo’s close friendship with the Spanish anarchist 
Florencio Bazora, one of the founders of the IWW and a comrade of the Italian 
anarchist Errico Malatesta, was probably the most important political relationship 
he developed. 
</p>

<p>
Although the influence of the Saint Louis anarchists upon Ricardo Flores 
Magon’s political opinions is uncertain, scholars believe that they might have 
reinforced ideas that were already fermenting in Flores Magon’s mind. However, 
when he first adopted the radical anarchist ideals that superseded his reform- 
</p>


<p>
BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH ★ 37 
</p>




<p>
ist liberal views remains an open question. 22 Many scholars believe that Flores 
Magon embraced anarchism as early as 1901, if not even earlier. Indeed, fellow 
activist Antonio Diaz Soto y Gama later proclaimed that, at that time, “We were all 
completely anarchists.” 23 The Liberal leader Camilo Arriaga owned a huge library 
of political thought, and it seems that, by 1901, Ricardo had used this resource to 
become familiar with the writings of Maxim Gorky, Peter Kropotkin, Errico Malat- 
esta, Karl Marx, Mikhail Bakunin, and Max Stirner. Flores Magon also encouraged 
the opposition Mexico City newspaper Vesper in 1902 to serialize Kropotkin’s 
anarchist classic, The Conquest of Bread. 
</p>

<p>
Flores Magon’s 1905 encounters with Bazora and other anarchists in 
Saint Louis undoubtedly influenced his thinking, but scholars do not possess 
much documentation about these discussions. Even though Flores Magon had not 
yet proclaimed any political philosophy, the Mexican dictator Porlirio Diaz began 
referring to him as a “dangerous anarchist ” in 1906. Ricardo Flores Magon’s first re¬ 
corded mention of anarchism was in a secretive 1908 letter to his brother Enrique 
and his comrade Praxedis Guerrero. However, he warned them to avoid using 
the term explicitly to avoid alienating potential supporters, because many people 
wrongly associated anarchism with random violence. Although Flores Magon’s 
writings during the following years clearly invoked anarchist concepts, he never 
used the word “anarchism” in any published document until after his 1914 release 
from prison. Because he was so reluctant to espouse publicly his commitment 
to anarchism, scholars can not be entirely sure of when he finally embraced the 
philosophy. Nevertheless, they agree that his writings and political analyses were 
always far more class conscious than those of most of the other liberal leaders. At 
all stages of the movement, Ricardo was its most radical spokesman, emphasizing 
the need fur social an* economic changes as well as political reforms. 
</p>

<p>
Flores Magon’s passion for revolutionary social and economic justice 
frightened away moderate and wealthy liberal factions who generally wanted 
only political reform.Throughout the history of the liberal movement, his radical 
views often alienated former allies. Ricardo’s brother Jesus sent him letters warn¬ 
ing him that he did not approve of Ricardo’s revolutionary tone. And as soon as 
Ricardo Flores Magon arrived in the United States to join the wealthy, influential 
founder of the Liberal Party, Camilo Arriaga, the two began to have disagreements 
about the group’s philosophy and tactics. Over time, their disagreements became 
more pronounced. Francisco I. Madero, a friend of Arriaga who had praised Flores 
Magon for “inflaming Mexicans to righteous indignation against the tyrant,” 24 sent 
him $700 to forward to Arriaga for promoting the cause of the Liberal Party. Rather 
</p>


<p>

</p>




<p>
than doing so, Flores Magon sent a letter to Madero denouncing Arriaga as a “false 
liberal.” In turn, Arriaga wrote Madero telling him that the Saint Louis group was 
defrauding contributors. 25 As a result of these philosophical and personal dis¬ 
agreements, Arriaga, along with several other moderates, moved back to Mexico. 
</p>


<p>
THE ORGANIZING JUNTA OF THE MEXICAN LIBERAL PARTY 
</p>

<p>
To distinguish themselves from the moderate wing of the Liberal Party, 
Ricardo Flores Magon, along with Juan Sarabia,Antonio I. Villarreal, Enrique Flores 
Magon, Librado Rivera, Manuel Sarabia, and Rosalio Bustamante, formed the Jun¬ 
ta Organizadora del Partido Liberal Mexicano (Organizing Junta of the Mexican 
Liberal Party), or PLM, on September 28, 1905. In their declaration of purpose, 
they explained that, even though they were now living in a foreign country, they 
would fight for Mexico using all available means against the dictatorship of Por- 
firio Diaz. They explained that Regeneration would be the official organ of the 
Junta, but also urged others to publish opposition newspapers to foment revolu¬ 
tion. They called for the formation of secret groups to meet periodically and to 
maintain communication with the Junta.These cells would send political notices, 
revolutionary plans, funds, and membership lists to Saint Louis. The Junta also 
asked members to show solidarity among their ranks by supporting poor, impris¬ 
oned, and otherwise oppressed members of the movement. 
</p>

<p>
Newspapers spread the ideas of the Junta. When Regeneration was de¬ 
livered to a plantation or an industrial center, peasants and proletarians would 
gather eagerly and the few literate members of the community would read to 
the rest. Long discussions followed these readings, and news of the insurgent 
movement soon spread. The Junta also made strong connections with other dis¬ 
sident papers on both sides of the border.Texas and Arizona papers printed their 
incendiary propaganda alongside stories about local struggles. In Mexico City, El 
Colmillo Publico published the Junta leaders’ invitation to join the new move¬ 
ment. 
</p>

<p>
In response to this call, an impressive network of between 40 and 70 revolution¬ 
ary cells sprouted up all over Mexico and the southwestern United States. In both 
countries, people were eager to overthrow the tyrant. Some Mexicans were so 
inspired that they even left their homes to join the Junta leaders in the United 
States. Some clubs had hundreds of members; some only a few. Local groups sent 
in their membership applications, pledged their dues, submitted the names of 
</p>


<p>

<p>
their officers, announced the mottoes of their clubs, and gave the Junta leads to 
other interested liberals. 
</p>

<p>
Groups wrote to the Saint Louis Junta from every state in the Mexican 
republic. In the mining town of Santa Barbara, Chihuahua, liberals formed a union 
and held rallies calling for revolution and criticizing their exploitation by mine 
owners. The peasants in Zacatecas sent in 25-cent contributions, a substantial 
amount for these severely impoverished people. 26 In Hidalgo, Prisciliano Silva led 
a well organized group with 75 men ready to revolt. 
</p>

<p>
Far away from the border, the Veracruz cells were very powerful. Un¬ 
derground organizations formed throughout the state, small newspapers were 
founded, and public demonstrations were held. The Puerto Mexico PLM cell had 
grown so vocal that police arrested its leader, Cipriano Medina, for speaking out 
against Diaz. 27 The state of Veracruz remained one of the major centers of PLM 
activity throughout the following years. 
</p>

<p>
The PLM also spread throughout the United States along the Mexican 
border, where a ready audience of immigrant and U.S.-born Mexicans hoped to 
overthrow Diaz. Along the Texas border, Mexican-American farm laborers and 
new workers from Mexico resented having to work on ranches owned by Ameri¬ 
cans who had stolen the land from them.The PLM made affiliations with activist 
institutions already within San Antonio, such as the newspaper La Humanidad , 
which criticized the oppression of farm workers. El Paso had a large club of over 
200 people that published three newspapers. In Del Rio, the newspapers El Men- 
sajcro (“The Messenger”) and 1810, founded by the longtime agitator Cresencio 
Villarreal Marquez, decried injustice along the border, criticized corrupt Mexican 
and U.S. officials, and spread the liberal message in their pages. 
</p>

<p>
In contrast to the primarily agricultural membership of the Texas groups, 
clubs in Arizona and New Mexico were composed mostly of mine workers. Min¬ 
ing companies operated freely in Arizona and New Mexico and in the northern 
Mexican states of Chihuahua and Sonora, treating the border as a legal formality. 
Labor also moved back and forth, with mine owners forcing workers to endure 
long hours and to suffer terrible working conditions. Collapses occurred frequent¬ 
ly, crushing hapless miners, and ventilation was rudimentary. In response, several 
union groups, such as the radical Western Federation of Miners, attempted to or¬ 
ganize the laborers. 
</p>

<p>
Douglas, Arizona was perhaps the most powerful liberal center. Its clubs 
contained at least 300 members, and it distributed Regeneration along with local 
opposition papers such as El Democrata. As with other groups, the Douglas clubs 
</p>


<p>

</p>




<p>
formulated plans for smuggling weapons across the border and for attacking the 
Mexican government. 
</p>

<p>
As the Junta had requested, most of the clubs in Mexico and United States 
operated as secretive organizations. Despite this secrecy, they were often infil¬ 
trated and betrayed by spies, and they consistently had to eject members .The lib¬ 
eral clubs often operated through front groups such as social centers, union halls, 
and even Masonic lodges. In certain cases, after meetings of the general group, 
select people would be invited to the secret meeting of the liberal organization. 
In one instance, the liberals even posed as a Mexican-American political club, 
and local politicians actually contributed money to win their votes. 28 At meet¬ 
ings of the PLM clubs, members agreed to the resolutions of September 28,1905, 
pledging allegiance to the Organizing Junta of the Mexican Liberal Party and its 
objectives. They elected officers, decided upon a motto, and maintained regular 
correspondence with the leaders in Saint Louis.The groups developed their own 
local initiatives, while also developing plans for the revolution, acquiring arms 
and ammunition, and identifying targets to attack. 
</p>

<p>
Coordinating this network of revolutionary cells was a major challenge. 
Some scholars have claimed that the lack of centralization and standard proce¬ 
dures led to the downfall of the PLM. 29 Whether or not this is so, reliable cor¬ 
respondence was essential to the development of the party. Liberal groups sent 
their revolutionary plans and all other information to Saint Louis, and the Junta 
leaders responded with advice and instructions. Both the Mexican and the U.S. 
governments intercepted much of this correspondence, which certainly impaired 
the revolutionaries’ efforts. 
</p>

<p>
Many of the most important members of the liberal movement, such 
as Praxedis Guerrero, Antonio de P. Araujo, and the Mayo Indian Fernando Palo- 
marez, 30 functioned as Special Delegates, coordinating the activities of various 
branches of the party. They spread the message of the Saint Louis Junta far and 
wide, recruiting new members and carrying correspondence between groups. 
They moved back and forth along the border, helping to smuggle arms and main¬ 
taining a watchful eye on military buildups. Such an important job was also an 
extremely dangerous one. With police, soldiers, detectives, and spies stationed on 
both sides of the border, Special Delegates ran a very real risk of being arrested 
and extradited to Mexico, where they would face imprisonment or execution. 
</p>

<p>
CHASED FROM THE HEARTLAND 
</p>

<p>
Not long after the Junta issued its call for the formation of liberal clubs, it 
encountered repression once again, this time in Saint Louis.The Mexican govern¬ 
ment had been trying to stop the circulation of Regeneration. It had instructed 
the postal service to intercept all communications with the Junta and to forward 
them to a Mexico City post office. Postal authorities then sent copies of these in¬ 
tercepted letters to the government. Mexican officials also hired Pinkerton spies 
and Thomas Furlong from the Furlong Detective Agency to monitor the Junta in 
Saint Louis. It even employed a spy, Ansel T. Adams, to wrangle a position inside 
Regeneration as its advertising manager. U.S. officials, particularly postal authori¬ 
ties, aided the Mexican government by confiscating donations to the group and 
intercepting correspondence. They also withdrew Regeneration’s fourth-class 
mailing permit.The Saint Louis postmaster even invited a private detective to his 
meeting with Flores Magon so the agent could identify the liberal leader in an 
upcoming trial. 31 
</p>

<p>
On October 12,1905, Ricardo and Enrique Flores Magon, along with Juan 
Sarabia, were arrested in their office by three Saint Louis detectives and two pri¬ 
vate detectives hired by the Mexican government. The authorities closed down 
the office of Regeneration and sold its property. Manuel Esperon de la Flor, the 
district political boss of Pochutla, Oaxaca, traveled to Missouri to charge the three 
with criminal libel for a defamatory article.This scathing indictment in Regener¬ 
ation had detailed the brutality of Esperon de la Flor’s rule. It further alleged that 
the governor of Oaxaca had given him his office as repayment for his wife’s sexual 
favors. 
</p>

<p>
News of the arrest spread quickly, engendering protest in both the United 
States and Mexico. In Mexico City, El Colmillo Publico encouraged letters and 
donations to support the Junta, raising 600 pesos, about $300, in one month. In 
Saint Louis, anarchists, socialists, and liberals, especially among the German and 
Russian populations, spoke out against the arrests. Local newspapers, such as the 
Saint Louis Post Dispatch and the Saint Louis Globe Democrat , condemned the 
trial. One individual even took out a full-page ad in the Sunday magazine section 
of the Post Dispatch to decry the injustice. 32 
</p>

<p>
The Flores Magon brothers and Juan Sarabia were finally released on 
bond in January 1906. However, legal proceedings had cost over $4000, com¬ 
pletely draining their resources. Fearing that they would be extradited to Mexico 
and executed, and knowing that spies were following them, most of the Junta 
leaders fled to Toronto. In Canada, they changed their names, posed as Italians, 
</p>


<p>

</p>




<p>
and worked for construction companies. However, they were unable to evade the 
spies of the Mexican government, who soon began interrogating their neighbors 
and co-workers. After a female Pinkerton agent seduced Manuel Sarabia into di¬ 
vulging the Junta’s secret hiding place, they fled to Montreal. Even there, agents 
pursued them, so they eventually returned to the United States. 
</p>

<p>
1906 PROGRAM AND MANIFESTO 
</p>

<p>
In April 1906, while they were in Canada, the Mexican exiles formulat¬ 
ed the Program and Manifesto of the Organizing Junta of the Mexican Liberal 
Party. As many scholars have pointed out, this was perhaps the most important, 
most comprehensive, and most far-reaching document of the Mexican Revolu¬ 
tion. It formed the basis of many other revolutionary documents, yet surpassed 
them in scope and ingenuity. It inspired the relatively mild reforms of Francisco 
I. Madero as well as the revolutionary agrarian program of Emiliano Zapata. The 
framers of today’s Mexican Constitution also borrowed heavily from it. 33 Fran¬ 
cisco J. Mujica, who began his political career writing for Regeneration about 
injustices in his state of Michoacan, 34 led the group that drafted the constitution 
in 1917. In particular, he helped to formulate article 123, probably the most radi¬ 
cal labor code at that time, which took most of its proposals from the earlier PLM 
document. 
</p>

<p>
Even though the 1906 Program and Manifesto was one of the most pro¬ 
gressive works in Mexican history, Ricardo Flores Magon’s own political views 
soon became even more radical. Despite his realization by 1908 (at the latest) that 
the revolution should be anarchist rather than reformist, he continued for years to 
use the 1906 document as the foundation for his struggle. 
</p>

<p>
The drafting of the Program and Manifesto was an intensely collabora¬ 
tive process. Ricardo’s brother Jesus had advised him to present the views of 
the majority. The avid writers of the Junta engaged in a phenomenal amount of 
correspondence to solicit the ideas of liberal club members and other readers 
of Regeneration. Through letters, as well as in the pages of Regeneration and 
El Colmillo Publico, people were asked to send their complaints and ideas for 
reform to Saint Louis. Because most of the Junta leaders had already fled this 
city, one of the few members remaining in Saint Louis, Librado Rivera, would 
then forward letters to the Junta leaders doubly exiled to Canada.Throughout the 
United States, Canada, and Mexico, in letters and the pages of newspapers, as well 
in the Mexican prisons of Belen and San Juan de Ulua, dissidents discussed the 
possibilities and submitted them to the liberal leaders. These suggestions seem 
</p>


<p>

</p>




<p>
to have been compiled mostly by Juan Sarabia and Antonio I. Villarreal as the text 
of the Program. Ricardo Flores Magon wrote the introductory Exposition and the 
concluding Manifesto. 
</p>

<p>
Once the 1906 Program and Manifesto was completed, papers such as 
Regeneration and El Colmillo Publico publicized it and they, along with the Jun¬ 
ta, requested money for its publication. At least 15,000 copies were sent to and 
circulated among liberal clubs in Mexico and the United States. Special Delegates 
also helped transmit it. Praxedis Guerrero brought it to the mine workers in the 
southwestern U.S. And across the border to mineworkers in Chihuahua and Sono¬ 
ra; Antonio I. Villarreal brought it to Texas and Mexico; Manuel Sarabia to Arizona; 
Ricardo Flores Magon to El Paso,Texas. 
</p>

<p>
Declaring its motto to be “Reforma, Libertad, y Justitia” the Program 
and Manifesto laid out a detailed plan that the party would instate once it had 
overthrown the dictator. The Exposition explained that, “Any political party that 
struggles to attain real influence in its country’s public realm is obligated to de¬ 
clare before the people, in a clear and precise form, what ideals it struggles for 
and what program it proposes to put into practice if it is favored by victory. In 
consequence, the Partido Liberal declares that its aspirations are those that are 
recorded in this present program, whose realization is strictly obligatory for the 
government that will be established after the fall of the dictatorship, also being 
the strict obligation of the members of the Partido Liberal to watch over the ful¬ 
fillment of this program.” 35 
</p>

<p>
The Partido Liberal would curb the powers of the executive branch, lim¬ 
iting the president to a four-year term with no possibility of re-election. It would 
require that all officials be honest and fair.The plan would curtail the injustice of 
the military: compulsory service would no longer be required of citizens; military 
tribunals would be abolished.To bring justice back to Mexico, the PLM would re¬ 
form the courts. Agricultural penal colonies would replace prisons, and the death 
penalty would be eliminated. The 1906 Program also promoted human rights. It 
stipulated that women would be considered equal to men in all regards. It would 
enforce the 1857 Laws of Reform, especially Juarez’s prescription of free and uni¬ 
versal secular education for all children. The PLM would also ensure liberty of 
speech and of the press. 
</p>

<p>
Whereas the 1857 Constitution had only dared to institute political re¬ 
forms, the 1906 Program proposed radical changes to better the working condi¬ 
tions of the urban proletariat and the rural peasant. It proposed to limit the work¬ 
ing day to eight hours, observe Sunday as a day of rest, and ensure each worker 
</p>


<p>

</p>




<p>
a minimum wage with pension benefits. The Program promoted unions, forbade 
child labor, and required decent working conditions. Along with these industrial 
reforms, the Program would also restore lands illegally confiscated from native 
tribes and other peasant communities. Lands appropriated from these seizures 
would be distributed among peasants. Loans from an agricultural bank would 
help them procure the lands. In addition to confiscating illegally obtained prop¬ 
erty and unused land, the PLM program also proposed making Mexican citizen¬ 
ship a mandatory condition of property ownership. 
</p>

<p>
This far-reaching, farseeing document concluded with a manifesto au¬ 
thored by Ricardo Flores Magon. Echoing the biblical prophets, the manifesto 
began by alerting Mexicans to the horror of their country’s enslavement. It beck¬ 
oned them to redeem their country through rebellion against the tyrant. Flores 
Magon stated, “I have here the program, the banner of the Partido Liberal, under 
which all of you should unite who have not renounced being free men, all of you 
who are smothering in this ignominious atmosphere which has enveloped you 
for thirty years, all of you who are ashamed of the enslavement of the country 
(which is your own slavery), all of you who hold against your tyrants the rebel¬ 
lion—blessed rebellion—of those restless under the yoke, because that feeling of 
rebellion is the signal that dignity and patriotism have not died in the heart that 
shelters them.” 36 
</p>

<p>
The manifesto concluded by calling upon Mexicans to assert their hu¬ 
man dignity, urging them to choose between the humiliating, miserable shackles 
of the dictatorship and the liberating vision of the PLM. “Between that which 
despotism offers you and that which the program of the Partido Liberal offers 
you, choose! If you want shackles, misery, humiliation before foreigners, the gray 
life of the debased outcast, supporting the dictatorship gives you all of this; if you 
prefer liberty, economic improvement, the raising up of the Mexican citizenry, the 
noble life of the man who is master of himself, come to the Partido Liberal that 
fraternizes with the noble and the virile, and join your efforts with those of all of 
us who fight for justice, to hurry the arrival of the radiant day on which tyranny 
will fall forever and the awaited democracy will surge forth with all the splendor 
of a star which never ceases shining brilliantly on the clear horizon of our coun¬ 
try.” 37 
</p>

<p>
As can be seen from the citations above, the 1906 Program and Manifesto 
had a deeply nationalistic character. It repeatedly referred to the land of Mexico as 
a patria (literally “fatherland”) and mentioned the people inhabiting it as a raza 
(“race”).The Manifesto fed off this nationalistic resentment, “look at our country 
</p>


<p>

<p>
now, oppressed, miserable, abject, the booty of foreigners, whose insolence has 
grown gigantic thanks to the cowardice of our tyrants; see how the despots have 
trampled national dignity, inviting foreign forces to invade our territory” 38 Indeed, 
liberals had good reasons for resenting foreign influences. As mentioned before, 
European imperialism had dominated the natives of Mexico from the 1511 Span¬ 
ish invasion to the 1864 imposition of Austrian archduke Maximilian as Emperor. 
The PLM particularly objected to Porfirio Diaz’s government that permitted, even 
encouraged, foreigners to seize Mexican natural resources and to exploit Mexican 
labor. 
</p>

<p>
One might be able to excuse the PLM’s nationalism as a natural reaction 
against imperialism. However, it manifested itself in one particularly ugly way in 
the 1906 Program and Manifesto: the PLM proposed eliminating Chinese immigra¬ 
tion to Mexico. Appealing to economic jingoism, the Manifesto explained, “The 
prohibition of Chinese immigration is, before all else, a measure to protect the 
workers of other nationalities, principally the Mexicans. The Chinese, disposed 
in general to work for the lowest salary, submissive, with meager aspirations, is a 
great obstacle to the prosperity of other workers. His competition is baneful and 
must be avoided in Mexico. In general, Chinese immigration does not produce the 
least benefit for Mexico.” 39 
</p>

<p>
As Flores Magon’s politics became more radical and more openly ex¬ 
pressed his anarchist beliefs, he largely abandoned this nationalist rhetoric for an 
internationalist ideology that emphasized the liberation of all mankind. Years later, 
Magon wrote an essay about the same problem that confronted Mexican liberals 
in 1906: what should one do when the labor market is flooded by foreign work¬ 
ers whom capitalists can use to lower wages. Rather than advocating economic 
nationalism, he explained “the cause of the wage-slave against his master has no 
frontiers; it is not a national problem but a universal conflict; it is the cause of all 
the disininherited of the world over, of every one who has to work with his hands 
and his brains to bring his family a loaf of bread.” 40 The First World War and the jin¬ 
goistic rhetoric that propelled it seem especially to have taught him the dangers 
of nationalism. In a 1917 essay, Flores Magon warned against the patriotism that 
“puts a bloody blindfold over your eyes when you see a foreigner; this patriotism 
that teaches you to hate everyone who wasn’t born in the land you were born 
in.” 41

<p>
CANANEA 
</p>

<p>
The network of cells organized by the PLM took the Program and Mani¬ 
festo of July 1, 1906 as its working document. Corresponding with Junta leaders 
in the U.S. And Canada, local groups crafted plans to foment revolution in Mexico 
and to install a government that would enact the PLM Program’s wide-ranging re¬ 
forms. Only a few months after its publication, groups throughout Mexico and the 
southwestern United States rose up against the dictator. In addition, the enthusi¬ 
astic reception that greeted the Program and Manifesto was in part fostered by an 
event that occurred a month before its publication.The June 1 strike in Cananea, 
Sonora, considered by many scholars to be the first major strike in modern Mexi¬ 
can history, 42 inspired people to consider the imminent need to dethrone the 
dictator. 
</p>

<p>
The PLM found many supporters among the economically and racially 
oppressed miners in Cananea, Sonora, about 100 miles south-southeast of Tucson, 
Arizona and 40 miles southeast of the twin cities of Nogales, Arizona and Nogales, 
Sonora. Along the borders of Arizona and New Mexico in the United States and 
Sonora and Chihuahua in Mexico, U.S. capitalists freely exploited mostly Mexi¬ 
can and Mexican-American labor. Investors from the United States owned about 
three-quarters of the mines in Mexico. As mentioned above, one of those exploit¬ 
ing cheap labor, Colonel William C. Greene, owner of the Cananea Consolidated 
Copper Company, had acquired his mine through Porfirio Diaz’s policies favoring 
foreign capital and via corrupt officials in the state of Sonora. 
</p>

<p>
As in other instances of foreign exploitation, the Mexican mine workers 
suffered from both economic misery and racism. The workers simply did not 
make enough money to survive.They had to pay for commodities in dollars, yet 
were paid in pesos, a much weaker currency. Instead of even earning proper wag¬ 
es, they often received only credit at the company store. Additionally, most had 
to live in overpriced company housing. As in most Mexican haciendas and many 
Mexican industrial towns, the company owners kept workers as virtual slaves 
by maintaining them in perpetual debt.To make matters even worse, Greene de¬ 
cided to slash the wages of Mexican workers, because the worldwide drop in 
copper prices was threatening the financial stability of his enterprise. Further, the 
governor of Sonora, Rafael Izabel, encouraged him to lower wages so that fewer 
agricultural laborers would leave the fields to work in the mines. 
</p>

<p>
In addition to this economic strife, most of the Cananea miners were 
Mexican, whereas the vast majority of the foremen and managers were from the 
United States.These supervisory workers worked much shorter hours and were 
</p>


<p>

<p>
paid in dollars rather than pesos, making two to four times as much as the Mexi¬ 
cans. This combination of economic and racial oppression combined to produce 
a volatile revolutionary sentiment fueled by financial desperation and patriotic 
pride. 
</p>

<p>
Cananea was typical of the industrial centers where a receptive audi¬ 
ence welcomed the radical vision of the PLM. Three months after the PLM had 
initially called Mexicans to form revolutionary cells in September 1905, organiz¬ 
ers in Cananea created the Union Liberal Humanidad.This group drafted bylaws 
that declared its support for the Junta and exchanged correspondence with the 
exiled leaders. At the same time, it also focused on local issues, awakening work¬ 
ers to labor grievances and attempting to create a miner s union.The club helped 
develop the 1906 Program and Manifesto by suggesting reforms in labor practices 
and the restoration of native lands. Members of the cell also maintained newspa¬ 
pers, such as El Centenario (“The Centennial”), which criticized mine policies, 
urged the creation of a union, and reprinted articles from Regeneration. On May 
5, the holiday celebrating Diaz’s 1862 defeat of the French invasion, the Union 
Liberal Humanidad organized an alternative rally. The principal speaker, social¬ 
ist lawyer Lazaro Gutierrez de Lara, exhorted workers to contribute to Mexican 
history by forming a union and securing their liberty. He further urged them to 
create a united miners’ movement with other Mexican workers in coalition with 
the PLM. 43 After this rally, Gutierrez de Lara organized a second group, the Club 
Liberal de Cananea, in the working class neighborhoods of the town. Members of 
this veil discussed the plans ol the Junta as well as immediate concerns such as 
wages, hours, discrimination, and working conditions. 
</p>

<p>
There is still a great deal of controversy about precisely how the strike 
in Cananea started and how much the PLM-affiliated clubs influenced it.They cer¬ 
tainly raised the workers’ consciousness of their need for a union and propelled 
them to think and talk about their oppression. However, it is unclear what spe¬ 
cific roles various liberals played during the development of the strike. It began 
on June 1, 1906 when Mexican laborers gathered in front of the Oversight Mine 
to prevent the 7:00 a.m. shift from going to work. Soon, other mines closed and 
over 2000 miners gathered on the Mexican side of town chanting “five pesos, 
eight hours.” 44 The mine owner, William C. Greene, decided to forestall any pos¬ 
sible confrontation by selecting a representative group to present their demands 
to him in writing. This group, many of whom were also prominent members of 
the two liberal clubs, asked, among other things, for better wages and for more 
</p>


<p>

</p>




<p>
Mexicans to be appointed as foremen and managers. In response, Greene wrote 
a letter refusing each request. 
</p>

<p>
Greene’s delay of the inevitable confrontation between capital and la¬ 
bor only exacerbated the tension. During this period, agitators spread a circular 
around town filled with inflammatory declarations against the mine owner’s op¬ 
pression and against the dictator who allowed foreign capital to exploit Mexican 
labor. It is unclear who authored this piece, whether it was a liberal leader, an 
unaffiliated individual, or even a company provocateur. Eventually, strike agita¬ 
tors fomented a general walkout, inspiring all Mexicans to leave their posts.They 
began to march toward the side of town where white workers lived, carrying 
banners and chanting “five pesos, eight hours.”The march was peaceful until the 
manager of the company lumberyard began hosing them down and then com¬ 
menced shooting at them. In response, the workers clubbed him to death. The 
manager’s brother attempted to save him by firing at workers.The workers killed 
him as well and set the lumberyard ablaze. After this, the strikers armed them¬ 
selves and continued to town, dynamiting company property and engaging in 
rifle battles with white workers.The fighting abated as Mexican army regiments 
came to town, disarming people and forcing them either to return to work or to 
enlist in the war against theYaqui Indians, who had rebelled against the dictator’s 
theft of their lands. 
</p>

<p>
During the confrontation, Greene made a critical misstep that greatly 
increased patriotic resentment against foreign capitalist exploitation in Mexico. 
When he saw Mexicans cross over to the white area of Cananea, he and the U.S. 
consular agent sent alarmed telegraphs to the U.S. Department of State and to So¬ 
nora Governor Izabel. Additionally, Greene sent messages to friends and newspa¬ 
pers in Arizona saying that the Mexicans were killing men, women and children. 
He warned of an imminent race war. Izabel then allowed a group of Arizona vol¬ 
unteers under the command of Ranger Captain Thomas Rynning to enter Sonora. 
By the time they arrived in Cananea, the situation had already calmed down to 
a state in which they were no longer needed. Given this somewhat chaotic but 
not at all critical condition, Governor Izabel asked the foreign fighters to return 
to the United States. Even though they had not fired a single shot, this violation 
of Mexican territorial sovereignty reflected poorly on the regime of Porfirio Diaz. 
Throughout the country, people regarded it as tantamount to a dictator-approved 
U.S. invasion of Mexican territory to protect U.S. capital from the threat of Mexi¬ 
can labor. For many, the Cananea strike inspired revolutionary awareness by ex¬ 
plicitly connecting workers’ rights with deep patriotic feeling. 
</p>


<p>
BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH ★ 49 
</p>




<p>
The strike led to harsh repression against liberals in both Cananea and 
in the United States. Greene and Governor Izabel blamed the local PLM groups 
for fomenting the uprising; they believed that the strike was intended to be the 
first stage of an all-out revolution against Diaz. Further, when authorities raided 
the clubs, they found letters from the Saint Louis Junta urging them to fight for 
better working and living conditions. Many liberal club members were impris¬ 
oned or conscripted into the army as retribution. However, both the liberals in 
Cananea and the leaders of the Junta denied responsibility for the strike. Antonio 
I. Villarreal told a Los Angeles newspaper that the Junta was striving for a revolu¬ 
tion, but Cananea was merely a labor dispute. 15 Nevertheless, Diaz informed the 
U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, David Thompson, that events in Cananea were part 
of a revolutionary effort to overthrow the government. A reporter stationed in 
Washington, DC for the Mexican paper, The Herald , learned of this communica¬ 
tion and published it, embarrassing both the United Sates and Mexico. ' 6 Diaz also 
warned the ambassador about the PLM Junta and asked him to suppress both the 
movement and its newspaper , Regeneration. In response, Thompson presented 
the U.S. Department of State with the journal, warning them that “[Diaz] has told 
me that the publishers of the paper are anarchistic in all that they advocate.” r 
</p>

<p>
THE 1906 REBELLIONS 
</p>

<p>
Whether or not the Cananea strike was part of the general strategy in¬ 
tended to bring about the great PLM revolution, coordinated uprisings did begin 
soon afterwards. More than 40 secret clubs formed in every state of Mexico and 
the southwestern U.S., and many of them developed plans for local uprisings. Ri¬ 
cardo Flores Magon realized that, if the revolution were to meet with success, all 
of the groups would have to work together, and he wanted to delay the rebellion 
until all were prepared so that it would be more powerful. Diaz could easily quash 
isolated revolts, but simultaneous insurgencies would divide federal forces and 
would inspire local communities to join the struggle.The liberal leaders decided 
to initiate the revolution around September 24. However, clubs would immedi¬ 
ately execute their plans before then if either another strike broke out in Cananea, 
if another club had begun its struggle, or if a Junta leader was arrested. 
</p>

<p>
Once victorious, the revolution would immediately institute the reforms 
of the 1906 Program. It would enact changes such as limiting the working day to 
eight hours and guaranteeing a minimum wage for all. Ousted officials would be 
put on trial and punished for their crimes. Free elections would follow Successful 
groups would try to procure money and munitions—generally from government 
</p>

</p>




<p>
institutions—to help the revolution continue, and the PLM would establish its 
headquarters in Mexico City. Fearing U.S. intervention, the Junta warned its parti¬ 
sans to leave foreigners alone except in self-defense. In September, the members 
of the Junta telegrammed President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt about its plans, 
assuring him that they intended only to provoke the overthrow of Porfirio Diaz, 
and meant no harm to the United States. The Junta emphasized that the dictator 
violated principles Americans hold dear: his government was undemocratic, did 
not respect its constitution, and upheld the institution of slavery. The PLM lead¬ 
ers assured the U.S. president that Mexico would become a true democracy that 
would establish friendly relations with its northern neighbor. Roosevelt seems to 
have ignored this communication, but J. B. Scott, a Department of State solicitor, 
assured the Department of Justice and the Missouri governor that these ideas 
could be expressed freely in the United States. 48 
</p>

<p>
Although Flores Magon realized how essential it would be to initiate 
simultaneous uprisings, organizing the revolts was a major challenge. Local clubs 
were to communicate their plans to the Saint Louis Junta, who in turn would 
coordinate the struggles and write back to the cells.To ensure security, individual 
groups generally did not know about each other, and the PLM used secret code 
names and code scripts in its correspondence. However, maintaining communica¬ 
tion was difficult, especially because much of the Junta leadership had fled Saint 
Louis. Additionally, both Mexican and U.S. postal authorities were intercepting the 
PLM’s mail.This enabled police to imprison agitators and to thwart revolutionary 
plans of various groups before they commenced. Realizing that the governments 
of both the U.S. And Mexico were monitoring them, the members of the Junta uti¬ 
lized traveling Special Delegates to handle much of the communication between 
cells, to promote the movement, to recruit new fighters, and to procure arms and 
ammunition. However, the PLM did not have enough couriers. Many were arrest¬ 
ed performing this extremely dangerous job, as soldiers and police forces on both 
sides of the border tried to suppress the revolution they knew was brewing. 
</p>

<p>
PLM UPRISINGS AND DOWNFALLS 
</p>

<p>
Because the governments of two countries were preparing for the PLM 
insurrections, they effectively suppressed most of them.The rebellion did not get 
off to a propitious start. One of the first groups that was apprehended was the 
powerful, well-organized cell in Douglas,Arizona. It had planned to lead expedi¬ 
tions into Mexico and proceed to Cananea, about 50 miles to the southwest. Along 
the way, the expeditions would have captured customs houses at the border, 
</p>


<p>

<p>
blown up railroads, cut telegraph wires, and raided stores for weapons. Acquiring 
arms and ammunition without attracting attention had been quite difficult, al¬ 
though the Douglas group had managed to smuggle rifles across the border. Addi¬ 
tionally, it had commissioned Javier Huitemea to rally the support of his brothers 
in the ruthlessly oppressed Yaqui tribe, promising the return of land that had been 
seized from them. &lt;9 
</p>

<p>
However, this ambitious plan was foiled before it could begin. U.S. And 
Mexican authorities knew that an uprising was developing, as they had noticed 
arms being smuggled across the border. Furthermore, Governor Izabel of Sonora 
hired a spy, Trinidad Gomez, to infiltrate the group. On September 4, 1906, the 
Ranger captain who had intervened during the Cananea strike,Thomas Rynning, 
led his troops and immigration officers to a meeting of the Douglas group. Of¬ 
ficers arrested seven members of this club for violating the neutrality law and 
deported others back to Mexico.Their raid also uncovered dynamite, pistols, and 
banners, as well as volumes of correspondence with the Saint Louis Junta. In the 
towns of Mowry and Patagonia, Arizona, about 75 miles to the west, police raided 
other cells, finding more maps and letters that revealed the PLM’s plans. 
</p>

<p>
In contrast to the Arizona groups, the Del Rio,Texas club met with some 
success. Its members had planned for months to lead a revolt in Jimenez, Coahuila, 
and began smuggling weapons to the city and surrounding towns. On Septem¬ 
ber 25, they launched a surprise attack on Jimenez, apprehending the mayor, the 
treasurer, and the tax collector.The insurgents left a receipt from the PLM for the 
$108.50 they withdrew from the treasury.Taking arms, ammunition, and horses 
to continue their struggle, the 80 rebels left Jimenez, cutting wires to prevent lo¬ 
cal officials from communicating with federal forces. However, a counsel in Eagle 
Pass, Texas had already reported the attack, and troops were already mobilized. 
Soon after they left Jimenez, soldiers from nearby Ciudad Porfirio Diaz pursued 
the rebels.The PLM fighters dispersed, seeing that they had neither enough man¬ 
power nor sufficient ammunition to confront the army. 
</p>

<p>
Far south of the border, powerful clubs throughout the state of Veracruz 
had developed detailed plans for their uprisings. They had recruited at least a 
thousand insurgents across the state. As in Sonora, many of PLM fighters were dis¬ 
possessed Indians fighting to take back lands the dictator had stolen from them. 
The liberal groups intended to initiate their revolts simultaneously throughout 
the state, but they were unable to do so. On September 30, Hilario Salas, who had 
met Ricardo Flores Magon in Mexico City years before, attacked Acayucan with 
over 200 followers.They seemed to be winning the battle until a bullet punctured 
</p>


<p>

</p>




<p>
Salas’ stomach, at which point he and his troops retreated. On September 29, 
liberals held a demonstration in Pajapan at a plantation. Protestors cut wires and 
recruited fighters for their uprising. The next day, they seized money going to 
treasury officials from the mails, and continued gathering fighters and ammuni¬ 
tion. On October 1, a few hours after Salas attacked Acayucan, Roman Marin led 
a force crying, “Long Live the Liberals!” and “Death to General Porfirio Diaz!” 50 
They imprisoned city officials, took funds from the mayor and the secretary, and 
appointed new officials in city hall. After this, they proceeded to Puerto Mexico 
to continue the struggle, but, short of ammunition, they had to retreat when they 
saw federal troops coming to the city. 
</p>

<p>
Enrique Novoa delayed his soldiers’ attack on nearby Minatitlan until Oc¬ 
tober 1 when he saw federal troops approaching. He suggested an ambush, but 
the proud Indians who composed most of his army felt this would be cowardly. 
In disgust, they deserted his command, leaving his army too weak to continue. 51 
Liberals led a successful assault on Ixhuatlan on October 1, imprisoning the jus¬ 
tice of the peace, the city attorney, and the police.They looted treasury funds and 
destroyed municipal and treasury records. However, a local citizen fleeing the 
invasion flagged down a ship. Unfortunately, this vessel was carrying the Minati¬ 
tlan political boss and a lieutenant leading a contingent of 25 soldiers. The troop 
heeded the citizen’s cry for help, expelling the insurgents from the city. 52 
</p>

<p>
As in Douglas, Arizona, treachery caused the collapse of the final Veracruz 
uprising, A few days after the failed assault on Acayucan, rebel forces regrouped 
outside of San Pedro Soteapan and successfully ambushed federal soldiers. The 
government troops waved the white flag of truce, promising to join the insur¬ 
gents in an attack on the town. However, when they reached San Pedro Soteapan, 
the mayor signaled the army soldiers, who then plunged their bayonets into the 
flanks of the rebel fighters. 53 
</p>

<p>
As retribution for these insurgencies, the Mexican government made ar¬ 
rests throughout Veracruz in October. It executed and imprisoned most of the 
leaders of the uprisings. About 200 individuals were sent to jail, including many 
who had not even participated in combat.Worst of all, the dictatorship brutally at¬ 
tacked several Indian villages in retaliation for their contributions to the revolts. 
The last major PLM attack was supposed to have been launched from El Paso, 
Texas. Ricardo Flores Magon and Juan Sarabia had arrived there on September 
2 from Montreal, and Antonio I. Villarreal joined them soon afterwards. They or¬ 
ganized the local population of unemployed migrant farm laborers and railroad 
workers to cross the Rio Grande and attack Chihuahua. From there, they would

<p>
control the states of Sonora and Coahuila through train lines.The Junta leaders co¬ 
ordinated the revolt from El Paso, gathering Winchester rifles, guns, ammunition, 
cartridges, bombs, and dynamite. 
</p>

<p>
The PLM intended to attack Ciudad Juarez, the city that Madero’s general, 
Pascual Orozco, would eventually capture in 1911, finally prompting Porfirio Diaz 
to resign.The liberals had prepared a detailed plan. They would begin by seizing 
the army’s warehouse to acquire weapons and by taking the customs house to 
get money.They would then attack the police station, the army barracks, the post 
office, city hall, various banks, and several haciendas. 
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, spies betrayed this detailed agenda.To muster a formidable fighting 
force against the dictatorship, Ricardo Flores Magon not only had reached out to 
industrial laborers and peasant farmers, but also had solicited members of the 
Mexican military for support. Under the dictatorship, many poor people were 
drafted into the army against their will, so Flores Magon expected at least some 
support from within the military.The PLM promised to promote Mexican military 
personnel two ranks when they joined the Junta’s battalions and guaranteed them 
a more generous salary. Flores Magon believed that many soldiers would fight to 
overthrow the government that had forcibly enlisted them. 
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, Mexican politicians cleverly used Flores Magon’s strategy 
against him. The Chihuahua governor instructed General Jose Maria de la Vega, 
commander of the 18th garrison in Ciudad Juarez, to use PLM’s solicitation to 
the military to defeat its revolutionary effort.The general sent two officers to in¬ 
filtrate the FI Paso movement with promises of directing PLM forces to weapon 
caches throughout Ciudad Juarez. On October 16, authorities arrested liberal lead¬ 
ers meeting in nearby Rio Grande City. Three days later, just before the intended 
invasion, the PLM office in El Paso was raided and the rebels were arrested. El Paso 
police found weapons and bombs, as well as stacks of letters and documents .They 
arrested many of the prominent PLM leaders. In Ciudad Juarez, Mexican police 
apprehended Juan Sarabia. Luckily, however, Ricardo Flores Magon successfully 
escaped, fleeing to the house of a local supporter, Modesto Diaz. 
</p>

<p>
PERSECUTION OF THE PLM 
</p>

<p>
The dictatorship sternly punished the PLM for its rebellions. In public, 
Porfirio Diaz denied the revolutionary import of the uprisings, claiming that they 
were caused by bands of dissatisfied Indians joined by unemployed railroad work¬ 
ers. 54 U.S. Ambassador Thompson informed Secretary of State Elihu Root that the 
attacks had no political significance whatsoever. Nevertheless, the Mexican gov- 
</p>


<p>
54 ★ DREAMS OF FREEDOM 
</p>




<p>
ernment stepped up its efforts to destroy the PLM, arresting members all over the 
country. Seventeen were arrested in Ciudad Juarez. Liberal clubs, Indian tribes, and 
even many innocent civilians were brutally treated in the state of Veracruz. Over 
200 PLM fighters were sentenced to the Mexican prison San Juan de Ulua.The 
governor of the state of Chihuahua, Enrique Creel, had the most success cracking 
down on the movement. He worked with Mexican Vice President Ramon Corral 
to round up all of the liberals in his state, ultimately bragging to President Diaz 
that he had cleared Chihuahua of conspirators. 
</p>

<p>
The documents and correspondence that Mexican officers had seized 
in raids of various clubs aided authorities in their pursuit of PLM members. The 
Mexican government opened and copied letters, retaining the names and ad¬ 
dresses listed in them.They even forged letters and sent them to sympathizers to 
collect more information. Mexican authorities swept through the country arrest¬ 
ing liberal combatants as well as unaffiliated persons. Not only were PLM mem¬ 
bers attacked, their supporters were as well. San Antonio,Texas authorities closed 
the PLM-affiliated journal La Humanidad. In Mexico City, police suppressed the 
newspaper El Colmillo Publico. Police so severely beat the paper’s old and sick 
director, the brilliant caricaturist Jesus Martinez Carrion, that he died in prison 
soon afterwards. 
</p>

<p>
The Mexican government was most concerned with stopping revolu¬ 
tion at its source by apprehending the leaders of the PLM. Juan Sarabia had been 
arrested with other liberal fighters near Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua right before 
the El Paso club was about to attack. Porfirio Diaz instructed judges to make sure 
Sarabia was sent to prison. Sarabia was indicted for murder, robbery, insults to 
the president, and rebellion. He denied the first three trumped-up charges, and 
defended himself brilliantly against the last accusation of rebellion. Rather than 
denying it, he asserted that the Constitution of 1857 empowered him with the 
political right to revolt against a tyrant. He stated, “While the Republic is a fact, 
while the venerable democratic institutions remain inviolate, while the majesty 
of the law is not offended, while authorities comply with their lofty mission to 
watch over the good and to guarantee the rights of citizens, rebellion will be a 
crime perfectly punishable that no one could justify; but when the Republic is 
a myth, when its institutions are iniquitously tattered, when the law only serves 
the derision of despotism, when authority is stripped of its character &#x2026;. rebellion 
must not be a political crime punishable by the Penal Code, but a right conceded 
to the oppressed by article 35 of [the] Constitution.” 55 The unsympathetic court 
sentenced him to seven years in San Juan de Ulua. 
</p>


<p>
BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH ★ 55 
</p>




<p>
The Mexican government also attempted to apprehend and extradite to 
Mexico PLM leaders living in the United States. After Antonio I. Villarreal was ar¬ 
rested in the raid on the El Paso club, he was charged with violating the United 
States neutrality law This statute forbids the initiation of combat on foreign ter¬ 
ritory from U.S. soil. However, the Mexican government preferred to bring Vil¬ 
larreal back over the border for punishment rather than putting him on trial in 
the U.S. After he was delivered to immigration authorities to face deportation, he 
requested permission to send a wire to his father and his sisters, who had been 
organizing a campaign for his freedom. Once he entered the Western Union office, 
he knocked out a guard and escaped out the back door, running away to the El 
Paso home of a liberal partisan. 56 
</p>

<p>
Authorities were most concerned about stopping the PLM’s inspirational 
leader and its newspaper, Regeneration. Worried by Ricardo Flores Magon’s es¬ 
cape, Chihuahua Governor Creel employed private detective Thomas Furlong to 
track him throughout the United States. William Greene, owner of the Cananea 
mine, became so obsessed with destroying the liberal movement that he filed a 
libel suit against the Junta. Saint Louis police arrested the last Junta leader remain¬ 
ing in the city, Librado Rivera, along with the typesetter of Regeneration. The two 
were detained three weeks in an Ironton, Missouri jail while the Mexican govern¬ 
ment attempted to manufacture charges against them. To guarantee extradition 
to Mexico, Mexican authorities accused them of murder and robbery. However, 
local supporters as well as newspapers like the Saint Louis Post Dispatch and the 
Saint Louts Globe Democrat ardently condemned these miscarriages of justice. 
On November 30,1906, United States Commissioner James R. Gray held a public 
hearing in Saint Louis. He ruled that the offense committed by Rivera was “entirely 
of a political nature” and freed the men. 57 A frightened Rivera left St. Louis to re¬ 
unite with Ricardo Flores Magon in Los Angeles, which at that time and for the 
next decade would be the most heavily socialist city in the United States.

RIO BLANCO 
</p>

<p>
Soon after the PLM uprisings, a major textile strike occurred in Rio Blan¬ 
co, Veracruz, further threatening Diaz’s dictatorship. In turn, the conflagration im¬ 
pelled the tyrant to crush dissent even more vigorously. In the summer of 1906, 
the Gran Circulo de Obreros Libres (“The Great Circle of Free Laborers ”) formed 
to organize workers, recognizing the leadership of the Saint Louis Junta and circu¬ 
lating Regeneration. The textile workers in Veracruz suffered terrible injustices. 
They worked 13-hour shifts, yet earned only 40 cents a day .Workers’ salaries were

quickly devoured by exorbitant prices at the company store and outrageous rents 
for company housing.Young children were forced to work in the mills.The situ¬ 
ation grew even worse after the declining cotton market prompted the owners’ 
federation, the Centro Industrial Mexicano, to slash wages. Aware of the rising 
tide of discontent, the owners also restricted workers’ access to reading materi¬ 
als. 
</p>

<p>
In December 1906, strikes broke out all over the nearby states of Puebla 
and Tlaxcaca. The workers submitted demands for shorter hours, higher wages, 
safer working conditions, and the elimination of child labor and company stores. 
The owners decided to ignore these demands, preferring instead to starve the 
workers into submission. However, laborers in other states showed great class 
solidarity by collecting money to support the strikers. In response, the owners’ 
federation decided to close down all of the mills throughout the region. On Janu¬ 
ary 4,1907, Diaz ordered that all textile factories be reopened and that all strikers 
return to work. Beyond the empty gesture of forbidding children younger than 
nine from working in the mills, the dictator made no attempt to respond to the 
strikers’ demands. However, he granted all the wishes of the owners. Additionally, 
he required all workers to carry identification notebooks at all times. 
</p>

<p>
Whereas most strikers were so worn down that they had to return to the 
factories, those in Rio Blanco, Veracruz rejected the settlement and remained on 
strike. After the French manager of the company store refused to sell a worker 
food for her starving family, people in the city rioted, looting the store and burn¬ 
ing it down. Federal troops responded to the uprising by shooting down laborers, 
but the crowd was too powerful for them.The rioters stormed the municipal pal¬ 
ace and then proceeded to the nearby village of Nogales. After the army turned 
them back, they returned to Rio Blanco. While they were gone, government forc¬ 
es sent from Veracruz and Puebla arrived in the city. When the workers arrived 
back home, federal forces engaged in a massacre of civilians, shooting down men, 
women, and children in the streets, and pursuing them through the surrounding 
towns. Many innocent people were ruthlessly murdered. Many others were jailed 
or conscripted into the army. 58 
</p>

<p>
As with the Cananea strike six months before, the brutal repression 
in Rio Blanco provoked strong reactions throughout Mexico. The nation was 
shocked by the amount of innocent blood spilled by federal troops. People once 
again became aware of the need to overthrow the dictator, making them more 
receptive to the message of the PLM. Enrique Creel, now serving as the Mexican 
ambassador to the United States, warned the U.S. Secretary of State Elihu Root

<p>
that Ricardo Flores Magon and the other exiled Junta members were damaging 
political relations with Mexico. He further warned that they would hurt U.S. eco¬ 
nomic investments in Mexico as well. Root contacted Attorney General Charles 
J. Bonaparte, asking him to help maintain friendly relations with Mexico by ap¬ 
prehending the PLM leaders. Already concerned by the Cananea strike and the 
various uprisings of 1906, the U.S. Department of Justice was convinced by this 
last message to pursue Ricardo Flores Magon and the other Junta members. 
</p>

<p>
MANUEL SARABIA KIDNAPPED 
</p>

<p>
On June 30, 1907, Arizona Ranger Sam J. Hayhurst arrested Manuel Sara- 
bia in Douglas. Sarabia had been organizing local mine workers and coordinating 
PLM activity in the area while working under the pseudonym “Sam Moret” as a 
printer and reporter for the Douglas International American. Authorities appre¬ 
hended Sarabia while he was depositing PLM correspondence on a train, confis¬ 
cating his letters and taking him to the city jail. That evening, a constable and the 
jailer took a resistant Sarabia from his cell, put him in a car, and drove him across 
the border, delivering him to Mexican rural police.These officers bound his hands 
and led him on a mule to a prison in Cananea. After spending two days in jail, he 
again rode a mule to Imuris, from where he was taken by train to the Sonora capi¬ 
tal, Hermosillo. 
</p>

<p>
Luckily, a Douglas laborer noticed Sarabia screaming for help and strug¬ 
gling against his captors. People throughout the city spoke out against his ap¬ 
prehension and an active campaign of protests drew attention to his case. Several 
groups of concerned citizens, including the Citizens Committee of Douglas, wrote 
letters and sent telegrams to the state and federal governments. Local newspapers 
such as the Douglas Daily Examiner and the Douglas Industrial denounced the 
kidnapping. Mary “Mother” Jones, the renowned labor activist, happened to be in 
Douglas to organize copper smelters. After learning about Sarabia, she powerfully 
condemned his arrest at a labor rally and then went to Phoenix to speak to the 
governor about it. The intense pressure put upon the Arizona and U.S. govern¬ 
ments secured Sarabia’s release. Arizona rangers and public investigators traveled 
down to Hermosillo, Sonora to bring him back to Douglas on July 12.This incident 
dramatically revealed to U.S. citizens, especially to leftists, that Mexico abused its 
dissidents, and that the U.S. government was aiding and abetting this repression.

<p>
RICARDO FLORES MAG6N IN LOS ANGELES 
</p>

<p>
Despite these assaults on the PLM leadership, the most important Junta 
member, Ricardo Flores Magon, still remained free, encouraging liberals through¬ 
out the U.S. And Mexico to continue the struggle. Although El Paso,Texas police 
raided the PLM club before it commenced its invasion of Ciudad Juarez, Flores 
Magon managed to escape. He fled first to the home of a local supporter, then to 
California. Concerned about capturing this inspirational figure, Mexican Ambas¬ 
sador Enrique Creel posted signs offering $20,000 for his capture throughout the 
U.S. And Mexico, and hired Thomas Furlong to pursue him. Furlong unsuccess¬ 
fully tried to find Flores Magon in El Paso and Austin,Texas,Toronto and Montreal, 
Canada, and New York City before looking in California. Years later, Flores Magon 
related in a prison letter to his friend Nicolas Bernal that these were grinding 
times for him: he hid himself away, often not eating for days, terrified that he 
would be deported to an execution in Mexico. He first arrived in Los Angeles,but 
soon realized that an agent was following him. Ricardo Flores Magon, somehow 
concealing his prominent moustache, evaded capture by dressing up as a woman 
and fleeing to San Francisco. Fearing pursuit there, he left for Sacramento, and 
then departed that city to settle back in Los Angeles. 
</p>

<p>
Even while he was running for his life, Ricardo Flores Magon continued 
to plot the Mexican revolution. Sensing that the dictatorship could no longer 
sustain its repressive regime, he continued to write to individuals and clubs, urg¬ 
ing them to continue the fight. One letter insisted, “One must not lose faith or 
be dismayed. Great causes are not lost nor won in a day.” 59 After another circular 
explained the causes of previous failures, it exhorted PLM members to collect 
money and weapons to prepare for the imminent insurrection.This document 
proposed essentially the same revolutionary agenda as before: federal soldiers 
would be promoted and paid better in the liberal army; corrupt officials would 
be put on trial; and the 1906 Program would be instituted, providing reforms such 
as a minimum wage and an eight-hour working day. Even though police crack¬ 
downs after the 1906 rebellions had destroyed or severely damaged many groups, 
various clubs developed plans for uprisings. As before, PLM cells hoped to invade 
border towns, blow up bridges, cut telegraph wires, and raid treasuries, thereby 
initiating the revolution. Junta leaders also planned to assassinate a high official in 
Chihuahua. 60 However, U.S. And Mexican authorities were aware of the possible 
revolt, so they stationed troops along the border. Soon rumors spread that the re¬ 
bellion would occur on Mexican Independence Bay, September 16,1907. Fearing

<p>
a catastrophe even worse than the 1906 attempts, the PLM held back for another 
year. 
</p>

<p>
Once Flores Magon and other prominent PLM members arrived in Los 
Angeles, they began publishing another newspaper. Along with Librado Rivera, 
Antonio I. Villarreal, Lazaro Gutierrez de Lara, and Modesto Diaz, Flores Magon 
published the first issue of Revolution on June 1,1907. It was distributed through¬ 
out California and the southwestern United States and smuggled into Mexico. In 
contrast to the Regeneration of previous years, this paper made much more pas¬ 
sionate, abrasive calls for revolution. Certain articles echoed German philosopher 
Friedrich Nietzsche in their criticism of a Christian slave morality that teaches 
humility and obedience. 61 For example, the essay “Clarion Call of Combat” de¬ 
clared, “It’s a lie that virtue resides in the suffering, pious, and obedient spirits! 
</p>

<p>
&#x2026; Never has altruism budded in these morbid, terrified temperaments; altruism 
is the patrimony of strong characters, of those abnegating individuals who love 
the others too much to forget about themselves.” 62 Similarly, Magon’s article “Go 
Towards Life” seems inspired by Nietzsche’s reflections on the death of god and 
metaphysics:“Religions are dissolving in the shadows of indifference.The Koran, 
the Vedas, the Bible no longer radiate glory: in their yellowing pages, sad gods are 
dying like the sun in a winter’s twilight. &#x2026; Social inequality died in theory when 
metaphysics died during the revolution in thought.” 63 Other essays in Revolution 
urged soldiers to join the revolution and citizens to procure weapons and become 
guerillas.The paper as a whole focused a great deal on labor issues and the class 
struggle. Although he did not explicitly state his philosophical leanings, Flores 
Magon’s writings began clearly to evoke anarchist notions, repeatedly stressing 
the importance of expropriating the land and distributing it to all. For example, 
he urged,“We do not fight for abstractions, but for material realities.We want land 
for everyone; for everyone, bread. Insofar as blood must necessarily flow, it will be 
so that the conquests we secure will benefit everyone and not just a certain social 
caste.” 64 
</p>

<p>
RICARDO FLORES MAGON AND OTHER JUNTA LEADERS APPREHENDED 
</p>

<p>
After having pursued the Junta leaders throughout the United States 
and Canada,Thomas Furlong finally apprehended them on August 23,1907. Even 
though they had no warrant to do so, he and several Mexican detectives arrested 
Ricardo Flores Magon, Librado Rivera, and Antonio I. Villarreal, dragging them from 
their house and seizing their correspondence. Flores Magon was beaten uncon¬ 
scious. Rivera cried out that they were being kidnapped. Because they attracted

</p>




<p>
so much attention, the Mexican government could not easily bring the prison¬ 
ers across the border as they had Manuel Sarabia. Instead, the three men were 
brought to the Los Angeles jail on charges of “resisting arrest.” Although both the 
Mexican and the U.S. governments wanted the Junta leaders behind bars, neither 
had decided what charges to lodge against them. Various libel suits had been filed 
against them, so there were many possible venues for a trial. Authorities tried to 
connect the prisoners with the planned El Paso invasion of Ciudad Juarez, but 
these charges would not have led to their deportation. Instead, the Mexican gov¬ 
ernment accused them of murder and robbery to ensure extradition, but soon 
admitted it had no evidence for this claim. 
</p>

<p>
Luckily, the PLM cause had drawn sufficient political attention in the U.S. 
to prevent deportation.The imprisoned men retained excellent, committed law¬ 
yers to dispute the specious charges of the Mexican government .The Mexican so¬ 
cialist lawyer Lazaro Gutierrez de Lara, who had previously organized unions and 
a PLM club in Cananea, was joined by two U.S. socialist lawyers, A. R. Holston and 
Job Harriman.The prominent Harriman had run for the vice-presidency in 1900 
on the Socialist Party ticket, and would almost win the Los Angeles mayoral seat 
in 1911 as a Socialist. The lawyers wrote to Washington to prevent the deporta¬ 
tion of the Junta leaders, eventually taking the case to the Supreme Court. Various 
concerned citizens groups also sent letters to Congress and the President to fight 
the extradition. Soon,Attorney General Charles J. Bonaparte realized that the case 
had become politically sensitive and warned against any illegal deportations. 
</p>

<p>
Authorities eventually decided to try the three men for violating the 
neutrality law by initiating a military offensive across the Mexican border from 
Douglas, Arizona. Flores Magon, Rivera, and Villarreal were released from the Los 
Angeles County Jail on September 24, 1907, and immediately rearrested on fed¬ 
eral charges. They were moved to Arizona, but the trial was delayed another 20 
months, finally beginning on May 12, 1909. By this time, the U.S. had grown so 
concerned with growing leftist movements in both the U.S. And Mexico, espe¬ 
cially the anarchist movement, that the trial became an indictment of radicalism. 
Porfirio Piaz informed prosecutor Joseph L. B. Alexander of the PLM’s anarchist 
tendencies. In turn, he insulted the defendants as “rank anarchists” to Attorney 
General Charles J. Bonaparte and as parasitic “grafters” before the jury. 65 
</p>

<p>
Even more than the prosecution, the PLM’s defense attorneys focused 
on the general issue of radicalism. Because their Los Angeles lawyers could not 
follow them to Arizona, the Western Federation of Miners (WFM) and the Politi¬ 
cal Refugee Defense League of Chicago hired new advocates to represent them. 
</p>


<p>
BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH ★ 61 
</p>




<p>
Unfortunately, the WFM was more concerned with recruiting Mexican labor than 
with fomenting the Mexican revolution. Its lawyers employed a basically inef¬ 
fective and specious argument to defend the liberal Junta. 66 Ignoring the PLM’s 
struggle against Porfirio Diaz’s dictatorship, the advocates portrayed the case as 
an attack on a group that ardently supported workers’ rights. Even if the attor¬ 
neys had chosen a more effective and more honest defense strategy, the evidence 
against Flores Magon, Rivera, and Villarreal was overwhelming. The raid on the 
Douglas PLM club had uncovered too many incriminating letters and detailed 
battle plans. Although the defense tried to overturn the case on various techni¬ 
calities, the three men were found guilty and sentenced to 18 months in federal 
prison at McNeil Island,Washington. 
</p>

<p>
Along with the Junta leadership, the newspaper it had founded in Los 
Angeles, Revolution, was also repressed. On September 27, 1907, police arrested 
on libel charges the paper’s printers and its editor, Lazaro Gutierrez de Lara, who 
was also defending the Junta in court. Although the printers were soon released, 
authorities kept Gutierrez de Lara in prison for three months as they tried to cre¬ 
ate a case to extradite him to Mexico. Eventually, they charged him with stealing 
wood in 1903.The value of this lumber was placed at $28, a sufficient amount to 
guarantee deportation. He and Job Harriman appealed the charges, and luckily 
succeeded in getting the case dismissed on a technicality. 
</p>

<p>
In Gutierrez de Lara’s stead, Praxedis Guerrero and Enrique Flores Magon 
went to Los Angeles to help Modesto Diaz and Manuel Sarabia continue publish¬ 
ing the paper. However, the Mexican government was still determined to shut 
it down. Like Flores Magon, Rivera, and Villarreal, Manuel Sarabia was arrested 
for conspiring in the Douglas, Arizona raids. The printers continued putting out 
the paper, but authorities soon incarcerated them for libel. Alter they were freed 
on bail, they were arrested yet again and the presses of Revolution were seized. 
Modesto Diaz died in his Los Angeles jail cell. Manuel Sarabia had become very 
sick with tuberculosis by the time he was released on bond. Afraid that he too 
might die if he returned to prison, Elizabeth Darling Trowbridge, a wealthy sup¬ 
porter of the PLM, married him and they fled together to England. After the sup¬ 
pression of Revolution , the PLM was unable to establish a sustained publishing ef¬ 
fort until Ricardo Flores Magon emerged from prison in 1910. Praxedis Guerrero 
periodically issued his newsletter Puntos Rojms (“Tracer Bullets”). Liberals and 
supporters in Los Angeles briefly put out the journal Libertady Trabajo (“Liberty 
and Work”), but this soon ended when its editors left to fight in the revolutionary 
uprisings of 1908. 
</p>

<p>
THE 1908 REBELLIONS 
</p>

<p>
While they were behind bars, the Junta leaders plotted a new set of up¬ 
risings in 1908. Despite the suppressions of PLM members and newspapers, they 
still communicated to liberals throughout Mexico and the United States. Even 
though he was being held incommunicado in jail, forbidden to write letters or 
publish articles, Ricardo Flores Magon continued to incite opposition through 
his pen. He smuggled out his writings by passing them to attorneys as well as 
by sewing them within his undergarments. A PLM supporter who worked in the 
prison laundry would then help route them to eager readers .Libertady Trabajo 
published his articles under the names of his common law wife, Maria Brousse 
Talavera, and her daughter Lucia. The letters he wrote instructed various PLM 
figures to plan revolts in Mexico, especially along the Texas and Arizona Borders. 
</p>

<p>
In addition to writing letters, the Junta members spread revolutionary 
fervor from their prison cells by writing a manifesto in December 1907. This 
document explained that they were still plotting the overthrow of Diaz and that 
PLM members should continue the struggle.This document was to be printed on 
broadsheets, distributed as pamphlets, posted on billboards, and even sent to of¬ 
ficials in the U.S. And Mexican governments. 67 
</p>

<p>
Flores Magon called for a general uprising to occur on June 25, 1908. 
He communicated his general battle plans and propaganda ideas to his brother 
Enrique and his comrade Praxedis Guerrero. They would then coordinate the 
insurgencies in detail. The country would be divided into five zones of activity, 
and the 60 or so PLM groups in Mexico and the U.S. would be responsible for 
fomenting rebellions in their respective zones. Additionally, PLM delegates would 
disseminate propaganda to recruit new members and form new clubs.The clubs 
would then gather weapons and develop new plans of attack. 
</p>

<p>
As most of the liberal cells were still along theTexas and Arizona borders, 
traveling Special Delegates were responsible for coordinating much of the activ¬ 
ity. They carried messages across the line between different groups, attempting 
to coordinate their activities with each other. Armed with credentials signed by 
Ricardo Flores Magon and lists of people to contact, they traveled all over Mexico 
and the southwestern U.S. On these tours, they raised money, gathered arms and 
ammunition, and recruited people to join the fight against the dictator. As before, 
liberals in the Mexican state of Sonora contacted the local Indian tribes to solicit 
their help. Yet the role of Special Delegate was as dangerous as ever, and many 
emissaries were arrested. 
</p>


<p>
BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH ★ 63 
</p>




<p>
In addition to coordinating the revolution from prison, Ricardo Flores 
Magon also communicated his vision for its ultimate goal. In a June 13, 1908 let¬ 
ter to his brother Enrique and his comrade Praxedis Guerrero, Ricardo stated 
explicitly that the forthcoming rebellion must be anarchist in nature. Warning that 
revolutions are always betrayed by leaders and bourgeois pressures that co-opt 
and corrupt the will of the people, he explained that the PLM fighters must strive 
for an anarcho-communist society in which peasants and workers themselves will 
directly own and control the land and the industries. However, Flores Magon fur¬ 
ther warned that various Junta leaders, including Antonio I. Villarreal and Manuel 
Sarabia, were too reformist to accept such radical ideas. He also feared that many 
PLM members might be intimidated by libertarian terminology “because they are 
so accustomed to hearing anarchists talked about in disparaging terms.” 68 Au¬ 
thorities and the press had libeled this movement as one that merely advocated 
violence rather than as an idealistic struggle for human liberation. 
</p>

<p>
In his 1908 prison letter, Ricardo Flores Magon instructed Enrique and 
Praxedis to avoid the anarchist label. He advised, “To obtain the great benefits for 
the people, real benefits, it is necessary to work as well-disguised anarchists, even 
from those who take us as their leaders. Everything boils down to a mere ques¬ 
tion of tactics. If from the start we would have called ourselves anarchists, no one, 
not even a few, would have listened to us.” 69 According to Flores Magon, the PLM 
should still fight under the aegis of liberalism, yet act like anarchists. He stated 
“We will continue calling ourselves liberals in the course of the revolution, but in 
reality 7 we will go on propagating anarchy and carrying out anarchist acts. We will 
continue expropriating from the bourgeoisie and making restitution to the peo¬ 
ple with what we seize.” 70 Some scholars have claimed that Ricardo Flores Magon 
made a tactical error in deceiving his supporters about his true political goals. 
In their view, not only did he forestall and aggravate rifts that were inevitable, he 
mistakenly underestimated the radical commitment of many Mexicans. 71 
</p>

<p>
After the previous revolutionary attempts, Mexican and U.S. Authorities 
prepared themselves for the imminent uprisings. Ambassador Enrique Creel wrote 
to the U.S. Secretary of State to warn that liberal groups were gathering weapons 
and money. The governments of both nations added troops along the border. Po¬ 
litical officials went into hiding. By June 1908, Mexico placed its northern states 
under martial law and stationed soldiers in villages and garrisons. 
</p>

<p>
Intercepted PLM communications aided authorities in their repression of 
liberal clubs. When the Mexican Consul in Los Angeles, Antonio Lozano, learned 
that Ricardo Flores Magon was sewing letters in his prison laundry, he photo- 
</p>


<p>

</p>




<p>
graphed them and sent copies to U.S. And Mexican authorities. Similarly, incom¬ 
ing letters were photographed and distributed. As a result, both governments 
arrested hundreds of PLM activists, many of whom were murdered. Detectives 
followed Praxedis Guerrero throughout his travels, yet never apprehended him. 
The Mexican government even employed a spy to pose as Antonio I. Villarreal and 
visit various liberal clubs. This impostor gathered details of the clubs’ plans and 
solicited names of other revolutionaries. Having gathered sufficient information, 
federal authorities raided PLM clubs throughout Mexico on June 23, seizing their 
arms and imprisoning their members. 
</p>

<p>
Ironically, perhaps the most important revolutionary attempt was foiled 
not by government vigilance, but by incredibly bad luck. As in 1906, the PLM club 
in El Paso hoped to capture Ciudad Juarez. Its members had readied between 200 
and 800 men, collected arms, made bombs, and identified strategic points of at¬ 
tack. They also developed plans about what they would do once they achieved 
victory. However, the club’s neighbor grew suspicious about the crates arriving 
next door, about the armed guards surrounding the house, and about the shots 
he heard at night. Fearing that he was living next to smugglers or thieves, he in¬ 
formed local police. On June 23, a city detective stopped the leaders of the club, 
and officers raided their headquarters. Inside, El Paso police found many guns, dy¬ 
namite sticks, bombs, and thousands of rifle cartridges. Additionally, they uncov¬ 
ered stacks of correspondence and maps indicating locations of banks, prisons, 
and municipal centers. Officers apprehended the PLM members, again charging 
them with violating the neutrality law. 
</p>

<p>
Revolts did break out in northern Mexico, but they were not well coordi¬ 
nated. Because they did not occur simultaneously, the Mexican government was 
able to defuse one after the other. On June 25, PLM fighters in the farming and 
rubber-producing city of Viesca, Coahuila rose up in arms.Two hundred or more 
fighters, including over 60 from a local hacienda, successfully captured the city, 
cheering “Down with the Dictatorship! ” and “Long live the Liberal Mexican Party! ” 
They took over the municipal palace and bombed the house of the district politi¬ 
cal boss.The PLM army ransacked offices and haciendas for money, food, horses, 
and weapons.They also opened the jails and freed the prisoners.The victorious 
liberals then instituted the 1906 program. To prevent federal forces from retak¬ 
ing the city, insurgents tore up railroad tracks and cut telegraph wires. After they 
had controlled the city for a day and a half, the PLM fighters moved on to attack 
the town of Matamoros. On the way, however, they encountered a large force of 
soldiers sent from the federal and state capitals. After an unsuccessful fight in the

<p>
mountains, the liberal forces scattered. Government troops advanced to Viesca, 
driving liberals from the city.They executed or imprisoned some 30 insurgents. 72 
</p>

<p>
None of the subsequent uprisings met with as much success as the Vi¬ 
esca revolt. Rebels had planned to attack Las Vacas, Coahuila from Del Rio,Texas 
on June 26. To prepare for the struggle, liberals had carefully hidden arms and 
ammunition along the river in Mexico. However, the attack did not happen as 
planned. Although the leader of the rebel infantry, Encarnacion Diaz Guerra, had 
his 60 troops ready for the early morning assault, the cavalry did not show up for 
many hours. After waiting a while, Diaz Guerra ordered an attack, and his fight¬ 
ers, chanting “Long Live Liberty!” and “Long Live the Liberal Club!”, entered the 
city. They fought soldiers, attacked the military barracks, even engaged in hand- 
to-hand combat against Diaz’s forces. However, the superior federal troops drove 
them from the city. Six hours later, the PLM cavalry finally showed up. A smaller 
force attempted another attack on the city, but it soon ran out of ammunition. PLM 
insurgents retreated again to the mountains, taking horses and ammunition from 
a local hacienda, dogged by troops tracking them. 
</p>

<p>
The rebels confronted additional problems when they crossed the bor¬ 
der to return to their Texas homes. Citizens in Del Rio had heard the shooting 
in nearby Las Vacas. Local authorities performed a census of the population to 
determine who had left for the struggle and to look for literature and weapons. 
One wounded leader made a full confession to the Del Rio police. Soon after this 
attempt on Las Vacas, remaining partisans from the failed El Paso attack on Ciudad 
Juarez regrouped to capture Palomas, Chihuahua. However, a U.S. citizen noticed 
11 liberal soldiers armed with rifles and cartridges marching toward Mexico on 
June 29. El Paso police notified Mexican authorities, so Palomas was prepared for 
the attack on July 1. A close friend or Praxeais Guerrero, Francisco Manriquez, was 
slain in the battle.The insurgents fled towards Casas Grandes, but when they got 
lost after their guide deserted them, they returned to El Paso. 
</p>

<p>
FALLOUT OF THE 1908 REBELLIONS 
</p>

<p>
As in 1906, PLM fighters and supporters were severely punished for the 
uprisings of 1908.The Mexican government hunted down leaders throughout the 
country, imprisoning and murdering them. Furthermore, the dictatorship made 
false promises of amnesty for PLM fighters, and some foolishly returned to Mex¬ 
ico where they were immediately arrested. U.S. Authorities also chased liberals, 
charging them with violating the neutrality law. Waco,Texas police and Thomas 
Furlong arrested the Special Delegate Antonio de P. Araujo, one of the travelers so 
</p>


<p>

</p>




<p>
important to maintaining contact between various sectors of the movement. He 
was sentenced to two-and-a-half years at the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth, 
Kansas for violating neutrality laws. Acting on information from Furlong, the U.S. 
Secret Service captured Encarnacion Diaz Guerra, commander of the Las Vacas 
assault, brutally fracturing his skull. On November 11, 1908, he was also sent to 
Leavenworth for the same crime as Araujo. 
</p>

<p>
As before, the Mexican government tried to downplay the revolutionary 
significance of the uprisings. Porfirio Diaz claimed that the fighting was merely 
the work of bandits and had no political significance.The Mexican Ambassador 
to the U.S., Enrique Creel, similarly denied that the uprisings grew out of a revo¬ 
lutionary movement. However, both the Mexican and the U.S. governments knew 
that this was a political attempt to overthrow the despot, not mere banditry. The 
U.S. Consul in Las Vacas noted that the insurgents neither robbed nor stole, and 
had the sympathy of the people. An editorial in the El Paso Times even more 
directly averred that this was a revolutionary attempt to topple an oppressive 
tyrant. 
</p>

<p>
Even though the uprisings of 1908 had ended so poorly, Enrique Flores 
Magon, Praxedis Guerrero, and Jesus Maria Rangel continued to organize anoth¬ 
er rebellion. Maria Rangel, a leader of the Las Vacas attack, had escaped from 
U.S. Authorities after his initial arrest, changing his identity and concealing him¬ 
self among the sizable San Antonio Mexican community. He continued collect¬ 
ing weapons and coordinating PLM cells throughout Texas until his capture on 
August 10, 1909. When they raided his home, authorities found many important 
documents that indicated the general plan for future uprisings during September 
1909 as well as a list of liberals throughout the U.S. Soon after Maria Rangel’s 
apprehension, San Antonio police also arrested liberal organizer and publisher 
Thomas Sarabia, cousin of Juan and brother of Manuel. Although many protested 
against the apprehension of the two activists, only Sarabia was freed because of 
lack of evidence. Maria Rangel joined other PLM fighters in Leavenworth prison 
incarcerated for violating the neutrality laws. 
</p>

<p>
Despite these further reductions in the PLM leadership, several impor¬ 
tant figures remained active. On Mexican Independence Day, September 16,1908, 
Fernando Palomarez, the Mayo Indian who had joined the PLM cause in Cananea, 
attempted to assassinate Porfirio Diaz when the dictator ascended the steps of 
the National Palace to invoke the Grito de Dolores. Unfortunately, the tyrant’s 
bulletproof vest deflected the shot. Luckily, the crowd helped Palomarez to es¬ 
cape. 73 Praxedis Guerrero, the scion of a wealthy Guanajuato landowner who

had abandoned his privilege to live among the poor workers of Mexico, success¬ 
fully avoided arrest throughout his busy organizing career. 74 Working sporadically 
as a lumberjack to support himself, he traveled around the U.S. border and into 
Mexico, spreading PLM ideas and talking to Mexicans and Mexican-Americans 
about the goals of the Junta. Encouraging people to arm themselves, he gathered 
money and weapons, and even smuggled rifles over the border. He helped many 
different clubs develop their revolutionary plans and coordinated strategies be¬ 
tween groups. Throughout his travels, various detectives, police, and military au¬ 
thorities pursued Guerrero, yet none ever caught him. In one instance, Houston 
police invaded his house and seized his documents, yet Guerrero managed to 
escape by tying together bed sheets and climbing out the back window. 75 
</p>

<p>
In addition to his indefatigable organizing work, Guerrero spread the lib¬ 
eral message through his essays and poetic epigrams, such as “It is better to die on 
your feet than to live on your knees.” He and Enrique Flores Magon published cir¬ 
culars and manifestoes that urged collective solidarity against the injustice of capi¬ 
talism, exhorting the world’s poor to rise up against the rich and powerful. After 
publishing these statements, Guerrero put together the newspaper Puntos Rojos 
with Thomas Sarabia and Jesus Maria Rangel. Its pages passionately urged people 
to overthrow the Mexican tyrant, exhorting them to purchase weapons and to 
organize militias. Puntos Rojos also discussed other radical themes. It highlighted 
the role of female soldiers in the liberal struggles, recommended the formation 
of a Pan American Labor League, and condemned the execution of the influential 
Spanish anarchist philosopher and educational reformer Francisco Ferrer Guar- 
dia.

<p>
SUPPORT AMONG IKE U.S. LEFT 
</p>

<p>
Although the PLM was severely weakened by the arrests and murders of 
so many of its Mexican and Mexican-American members, many white leftists in 
the U.S. came to its aid. Rather than contributing to the development of another 
rebellion, most of these radicals assisted the PLM through legal support. Anar¬ 
chists, socialists, and labor activists wrote letters to protest the persecution of 
PLM captives and helped fund legal defense. However, substantial rifts occurred 
with several labor and socialist groups. After telling his brother that “this is tru¬ 
ly a country of pigs,” 76 Ricardo Flores Magon lamented to his wife Maria that 
many U.S. leftists condescended to the PLM because “we are poor Mexicans. &#x2026; 
This is our fault. Our skins are not white.” 77 U.S. support for the Mexican move¬ 
ment was uneven at times, and many labor and socialist leaders deserted Ricardo

<p>
Flores Magon and perhaps even harmed him over the years. Nevertheless, Flores 
Magon’s dream could not have survived without the aid of North American left¬ 
ists, especially as his opportunities in Mexico collapsed and his legal troubles in 
the U.S. mushroomed. 
</p>

<p>
Flores Magon actively encouraged PLM members to associate with radi¬ 
cal groups in their country of exile. Whereas he had previously regarded his revo¬ 
lutionary mission as the liberation of the Mexican peasantry and proletariat, he re¬ 
alized that his struggle was part of the international fight against the exploitation 
of capitalism, tyranny of government, and brainwashing of religion. In the wake of 
his philosophical rifts with prominent Junta leaders such as Manuel Sarabia and 
Antonio I. Villarreal, Ricardo urged PLM members to affiliate with socialist groups 
and spread their message at socialist meetings. 
</p>

<p>
As a journalist, Flores Magon understood the importance of support 
among the U.S. press. Newspapers in Saint Louis, Missouri and Douglas, Arizona 
had vigorously denounced the apprehensions of Junta leaders, helping to secure 
their freedom. Flores Magon knew that the backing of radical journals would be 
essential to the survival of the PLM. There was already much controversy in the 
U.S. press about the PLM. The radical press heartily supported the PLM cause, 
but many mainstream papers attacked the group. One San Francisco newspaper 
fired journalist Ethel Mowbray Dolson for her sympathetic interviews with Flores 
Magon,Villarreal, and Rivera. 
</p>

<p>
Left-wing Spanish-language papers supported the PLM’s struggle and 
protested its political persecution, but conservative papers mocked and insulted 
the PLM leaders. While newspapers in Texas generally supported the PLM’s ef¬ 
forts, the daily press in Los Angeles was hostile. L.A. newspaper moguls had ac¬ 
quired substantial interests in Mexico from the corrupt policies and cronyism 
of Porfirio Piaz’s dictatorship. General Harrison Gray Otis, publisher of the Los 
Angeles Times , owned 850,000 acres of land in Mexico. E.T. Earl, owner of the Los 
Angeles Express, was president of Sinaloa Land and Water, which possessed three 
million acres. William Randolph Hearst, owner of the Los Angeles Examiner, con¬ 
trolled mines, ranches, and railroads in Mexico. 78 These three papers ruthlessly 
attacked the PLM leadership, and left-wing journals defended them against these 
calumnies. 
</p>

<p>
One of the reasons why U.S. leftists supported the exiled Mexican dis¬ 
sidents was because they themselves were encountering harsh repression from 
the government. In the wake of massive labor protests in the 1890s, Congress 
had passed a law in 1902 making it illegal to advocate changes in property

<p>
ownership. Almost a century before George W. Bush proclaimed his War on Terror, 
President Theodore Roosevelt declared a War on Anarchists. 79 Just like Bush fuels 
his current campaign with barely disguised racism and xenophobia, Roosevelt 
similarly targeted aliens living in the U.S.In 1903, he signed a law that stipulated 
the deportation of any immigrant anarchist who had been in the U.S. for less than 
three years. After sundry anarchist activities in 1908 and 1909, such as the murder 
of a Denver priest, the explosion of a bomb in New York City’s Union Square, and 
an assassination attempt on the Chicago chief of police, the government stepped 
up its efforts to suppress anarchist papers and deport foreign anarchists. 80 Given 
this brutal political climate, the PLM garnered significant sympathy among the 
socialist, labor, and anarchist movements. 
</p>

<p>
Local, national, and even international socialist organizations rallied 
against the imprisonment of the Mexican radicals, raising money for their defense 
and passing resolutions calling for their release. In response, members of these 
groups sent letters soliciting pardons to presidents Roosevelt and Taft and other 
important government officials. Los Angeles organizations often discussed and 
publicly protested against the evils of the Mexican dictatorship. As mentioned 
above, the prominent L.A. socialist attorneys Job Harriman and A. R. Holston rep¬ 
resented the PLM leaders in court. The North American socialist leader Eugene V. 
Debs passionately defended the Mexican dissidents, speaking about their cause at 
rallies, publishing articles about their fate in socialist newspapers, and distributing 
a pamphlet about them, Political Prisoners Held in the United States. He even 
made their liberty an issue in his 1908 run for the U.S. presidency. 
</p>

<p>
The most important socialist newspaper in the states .Appeal to Reason 
(prior to WWI the largest-circulation periodical—of any sort—in the world), de¬ 
voted the entirety of its March 13, 1909 issue to the PLM cause. It printed a let¬ 
ter from Ricardo Flores Magon explaining the reasons for the arrest of the PLM 
leadership and describing the abuse inflicted upon him and the others in prison: 
their visitors were harassed; they were forbidden to receive books or magazines; 
and Librado Rivera’s wife was even molested by jailers in a search of her person. 
In a later issue of Appeal to Reason , the editors wrote and published a manifesto 
on the front page that exhorted its readers to solidarity between the U.S. And 
Mexican working class, instructing them that supporting the PLM would further 
the international revolutionary movement. 
</p>

<p>
The PLM was especially helped by several prominent socialists who 
came to Los Angeles to involve themselves deeply in the liberal struggle. The 
young journalist John Kenneth Turner and his wife Ethel DuffyTurner supported 
</p>


<p>

</p>




<p>
Ricardo Flores Magon through many phases of his life and even after his death. 
The Turners first met the Junta leaders while interviewing them in their Los An¬ 
geles prison cells. The convicts’ tales of Diaz’s brutal oppression horrified them. 
Determined to expose these evils, John Kenneth Turner recruited PLM member 
and socialist Lazaro Gutierrez de Lara to guide him through Mexico. In reaction to 
his discoveries, he wrote an influential series of articles detailing the evils of the 
tyrant’s Mexico.These essays described the systematic extermination of the Yaqui 
Indians and the perpetuation of slavery in Oaxacan tobacco plantations and Yu¬ 
catan hemp fields.They also explained how the dictator systematically destroyed 
all voices of political protest. Pointedly, these articles further implicated the U.S. 
government and businesses for giving the Diaz regime financial and moral sup¬ 
port. First published in American Magazine in 1909, these essays were collected 
and published as the book Barbarous Mexico in 1911. In later years, the Turners 
helped the PLM organize revolutionary attempts, and even smuggled arms across 
the border. To mourn Flores Magon’s passing, Ethel Duffy Turner wrote one of the 
most thorough histories of his life and his movement, Ricardo Flores Magon and 
the Mexican Liberal Party , which was later translated and published as Ricardo 
Flores Magon y El Partido Liberal Mexicano. 
</p>

<p>
Like the Turners, socialist John Murray was outraged by the injustice in 
Mexico and by the imprisonment of its dissidents in the U.S. He contacted a Penn¬ 
sylvania congressman to investigate the political persecution, which resulted in 
a 1910 congressional investigation. 81 He helped found the socialist newspaper 
Tbe Border to reveal the atrocities committed by the Mexican dictator, especially 
detailing injustice along the frontier. It called attention to the fate of the PLM and 
its leaders, calling them “The Men Diaz Dreads.” Like John Kenneth Turner, Murray 
decided to travel through Mexico to investigate conditions firsthand. Carrying a 
letter of introduction from Ricardo Flores Magon that contained the date for the 
upcoming revolution, he contacted PLM clubs and imprisoned members through¬ 
out Mexico. His reports detailed harsh labor conditions in places such as the tex¬ 
tile factories of Rio Blanco, as well as brutality in prisons such as San Juan de Ulua 
and Belen. In addition to the Turners and Murray, the wealthy Boston libertarian 
socialist Elizabeth Darling Trowbridge came to Los Angeles to help the perse¬ 
cuted Junta leaders. She wrote letters to various government officials requesting 
pardons, funded the publication of pamphlets and newspapers, financed Turner 
and Murray’s trips to Mexico, and supported the families of Ricardo Flores Magon 
and Librado Rivera. 
</p>


<p>
BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH ★ 71 
</p>




<p>
These engaged supporters also helped form special committees to se¬ 
cure the freedom of the imprisoned Junta leaders. John Kenneth Turner, Murray, 
and Trowbridge created the Mexican Revolutionist Defense League to publicize 
their plight and solicit aid. The Defense Committee of Los Angeles also collected 
funds for attorney fees and transcript requests. John Murray contacted the Chi¬ 
cago Political Refugee Defense League. This group, which had typically fought 
for Russian exiles, protested against the persecution of the PLM, holding rallies, 
releasing bulletins, and sending letters of protest to the U.S. Secretary of State. 
</p>

<p>
Like the socialists, labor unions organized substantial support for the 
PLM. Because they were generally quite militant and their membership contained 
a high proportion of Mexican-American workers, miners’ unions were particularly 
vocal. The miners’ magazine Labor Literature publicized the plight of the Junta 
leaders. As discussed previously, the tireless labor activist and IWW organizer 
Mother Jones first became aware of the PLM when she protested against Manuel 
Sarabia’s arrest at a Douglas,Arizona rally for a copper smelter’s union. She toured 
the country discussing the PLM leadership’s plight to unions, raising $1000 from 
the United Mine Workers and $3000 from other unions.The UMW also passed a 
resolution to help the persecuted Mexicans. The radical Western Federation of 
Miners, one of the primary participants in the formation of the syndicalist Indus¬ 
trial Workers of the World, had encountered the PLM before and continued to 
support them .The WFM had actively recruited Mexican-American and Mexican la¬ 
borers in Arizona and Sonora mines, and its members may have been key organiz¬ 
ers of the 1906 Cananca, Sonora strike.lt raised over $1300 to fund Flores Magon, 
Villarreal, and Rivera’s legal defense. As mentioned above, the WFM also hired the 
union lawyers who represented the men in their 1909 Arizona trial. 
</p>

<p>
Not just the miiicis, but also the entire labor community spoke out 
against the persecution of Mexican dissidents.The Los Angeles Labor Council is¬ 
sued a statement decrying the U.S. government that condemned these men for 
helping the working class. At every level, from small locals to national federations, 
unions rallied to the PLM cause. As one small example, Shreveport, Louisiana Lo¬ 
cal 215 of the Women’s International Labor League wrote a letter of protest to 
the U.S. Attorney General. 82 On November 13, 1908, the American Federation of 
Labor, the largest union organization in the U.S., passed a resolution that pledged 
sympathy and solicited support for the PLM leaders. When the president of the 
AFL, Samuel Gompers, later met with President Roosevelt, he also delivered to him 
a letter about the unjustly locked-up Junta members. 
</p>


<p>
72 ★ DREAMS OF FREEDOM 
</p>




<p>
Whereas the labor and socialist movements eventually broke with the 
PLM, anarchists supported the PLM throughout its struggle. Emma Goldman and 
Alexander Berkman protested the treatment of Flores Magon and his cohorts. 
They solicited funds at massive protests and speaking engagements. Goldman 
published articles about the PLM and the Mexican revolution in her journal, 
Mother Earth , and Berkman did so in his paper, The Blast. Mother Earth also 
published Ricardo Flores Magon’s “Manifesto to the American People” that de¬ 
tailed the persecution of the PLM to citizens of “the free fatherland of Washing¬ 
ton” and exhorted them to support the Mexican struggle in the name of interna¬ 
tional working-class solidarity. 83 Similarly, the prominent U.S. anarchist Voltairine 
de Cleyre spoke out at rallies against the imprisonment of the PLM leaders and 
even became the Chicago correspondent for Regeneracion. Internationally, fig¬ 
ures such as the great Russian anarchist Peter Kropotkin came to the defense of 
Ricardo Flores Magon. 
</p>

<p>
THE OPENING YEARS OF THE MEXICAN REVOLUTION 
</p>

<p>
The PLM prisoners feared that the Mexican dictator Porfirio Diaz might 
still attempt to apprehend or murder them even after they got out of jail. To 
prevent any such intrigue, John Kenneth Turner and members of the Western 
Federation of Miners met Ricardo Flores Magon, Librado Rivera, and Antonio I. Vil¬ 
larreal on their August 3,1910 release from prison in Arizona and guided them to 
the railroad station. A large crowd, cheering and throwing flowers, greeted them 
when they disembarked in Los Angeles. A few evenings later, over 2000 support¬ 
ers attended a fundraiser for the men at the Los Angeles Labor Temple. John Ken¬ 
neth Turner and Los Angeles lawyers Holston and Harriman discussed the perse¬ 
cution of the PLM and aspects of the legal case. Antonio Villarreal stated that the 
fight for freedom would continue. An exhausted and sick Ricardo Flores Magon 
spoke briefly, leading rousing chants of “jViva la Revolucion Social!” With the 
$414.66 raised from this event, the Junta leaders restarted their newspaper, Re¬ 
generacion. 
</p>

<p>
Almost a decade after its first issue was published in Mexico City, the first 
Los Angeles edition of Regeneracion appeared on September 3,1910. It achieved 
a circulation of over 12,000 by early November. In the lead editorial of its pre¬ 
miere issue, Ricardo Flores Magon bravely asserted “here we are again at our com¬ 
bat posts,” vowing to foment armed revolution against Porfirio Diaz. 
</p>

<p>
Additionally, Flores Magon seems to have developed his radical political 
views during his years in prison. His essays in this new version of Regeneracion

<p>

<p>
did not merely address the situation in Mexico, but also proposed a vision of an 
international anarchism. In contrast to the 1906 slogan of “Reform, Liberty, and 
Justice,” Flores Magon proclaimed a motto that had originated with the Russian 
narodnik movement and was employed by Spanish anarchists :Tierra y Libertad, 
Land and Liberty. 84 
</p>

<p>
As he could feel the Mexican Revolution quickly approaching, Flores 
Magon filled the pages of Regeneration with passionate exhortations to violent 
rebellion. “Workers, my friends, listen: it’s necessary, it’s urgent that you carry the 
revolution to the point where it reflects the consciousness of the epoch; it’s nec¬ 
essary, it’s urgent that it incarnates the great spiritual battle of the century.” 85 He 
denounced the oppression of the dictator and the exploitation of capitalism. Ex¬ 
plaining that economic equality is the basis of liberty, he urged Mexican work¬ 
ers and peasants to foment the revolution themselves, taking possession of the 
factories and the land. “We ought to keep in mind that what is needed is that the 
people have bread, shelter, and land to cultivate; we ought to keep in mind that no 
government, no matter how good its intents, can declare the abolition of misery. 
It’s the people themselves, the hungry, the dispossessed who must abolish misery, 
taking, in the first place, possession of the earth which, by natural right, cannot be 
monopolized by a few, but is the property of every human being.” 86 
</p>

<p>
In other essays, Flores Magon envisioned the revolutionary not as a politi¬ 
cal or military leader, but as one who sows the seeds of ideals. 87 On a philosophi¬ 
cal note, he imagined the force of discord as the one that propels humanity for¬ 
ward. “Always revolutionary, discord makes disgust ferment in proletarian breasts 
until, their nerves pulled tight until they are ready to snap, desperation makes 
hands search for rocks, bombs, daggers, revolvers, rifles, and men cast themselves 
against injustice, intending each one to be a hero.” 88 
</p>

<p>
In addition to its Mexican focus, Regeneration also addressed the con¬ 
cerns of its readers in the North America. The Junta was especially worried that 
the U.S. government might intervene to support Diaz against the coming uprising. 
It also addressed social and economic problems faced by Mexicans in the U.S., 
criticizing widespread racism and lamenting the lack of schools for brown chil¬ 
dren. “Everyone knows the contempt in which Mexicans in general are treated; 
everyone knows that in Texas Mexicans are treated worse than blacks. Mexicans 
are not admitted to hotels, restaurants, and other public establishments in Tex¬ 
as. The public schools close their doors to children of our race. North American 
semi-savages take target practice on Mexicans. How many men of our race have 
died because a white-skinned savage decided to prove his ability with firearms by

</p>




<p>
shooting at us—and without having any dispute with us! In the so-called courts 
of justice, Mexicans are judged, generally without bothering with legal formalities, 
and are sentenced to hang or to suffer other horrendous penalties without there 
being proof, or even the suspicion that they actually committed the crimes for 
which they are sentenced.” 89 
</p>

<p>
For the first time in its history, Regeneration reached out to U.S. leftists 
by including a page written entirely in English. Fearing that socialist and labor 
supporters would abandon him if he were too open about his anarchism, Flores 
Magon initially filled these pages with reformist rather than radical proclama- 
tions.While Spanish readers were exhorted to expropriate the land, English ones 
read proposals for incremental change taken from the 1906 Program. However, 
the developing revolution in Mexico required Flores Magon to clearly distinguish 
his dreams for human freedom from less idealistic ones. He could no longer afford 
to conceal his true political intentions. His radicalism alienated the first editor of 
the English-language page, the Los Angeles socialist Alfred Sanftleben, as well as 
the second editor, Ethel Duffy Turner. Only in April 15,1911, when the British an¬ 
archist William C. Owen took over this responsibility, did the newspaper honestly 
declare its guiding ideology to all of its audiences. 
</p>

<p>
Soon after Regeneration began its publication in Los Angeles, the Mexi¬ 
can Revolution erupted, finally ousting Porfirio Diaz.Wealthy Coahuila landowner 
and former Flores Magon supporter Francisco I. Madero had tried to run for the 
presidency against the dictator, vowing to abolish the laws that permitted re- 
elections. After he was arrested by the tyrant before the June 21, 1910 vote, and 
then released through the influence of his powerful family, Madero fled to the 
United States. On October 10, 1910, he issued his Plan de San Luis Potosi call¬ 
ing for a revolution. Unlike Flores Magon’s radical focus on social and economic 
changes, the privileged Madero only argued for the political reforms of “effective 
suffrage” and “no re-election,” the same changes that Diaz had called for in his 
Plan deTuxtepec. Rather than envisioning true social liberty, Madero only sought 
a well-ordered electoral democracy. 
</p>

<p>
On November 20, Madero’s supporters fomented an uprising in the state 
of Chihuahua. Citizens throughout Mexico followed their example. Ironically, 
in contrast to Flores Magon and most other leaders in the Mexican Revolution, 
Madero—whose mild reformist call had been the immediate spark that ignited 
the revolution—was timid about confronting the dictatorship. As an example, 
Madero refused to attack Ciudad Juarez, the border city that the PLM had tar¬ 
geted so many times, for fear that stray bullets might fall on U.S. soil and thereby

<p>
provoke U.S. intervention. Nevertheless, his general Pascual Orozco and former 
bandit leader Francisco “Pancho” Villa ignored his orders, taking the city on May 
13,1911. Porfirio Diaz fled for Europe on May 25. 90 
</p>


<p>
PLM REBELLIONS DURING THE MEXICAN REVOLUTION 
</p>

<p>
Ricardo Flores Magon had tried many times before to foment the rebel¬ 
lion that would overthrow Porfirio Diaz and bring justice to the Mexican peasant 
and proletariat. Because he had been free only a few months before its eruption, 
he did not have sufficient time to coordinate PLM activities before the outbreak of 
the revolution. Nevertheless, Flores Magon formulated several attempts to inaugu¬ 
rate a true social, economic, and political revolution before and during the course 
of the great insurrection. He instructed PLM fighters to forestall their uprisings 
until the presidential election to take advantage of growing dissent and chaos. 
Knowing that Madero would begin his military struggle on November 20th, Flores 
Magon instructed many clubs to delay their attacks until this date. In the pages 
of the November 16 th Regeneration, he urged his readership to rise up alongside 
Madero’s partisans, but not to join Madero’s forces. 
</p>

<p>
Although Flores Magon tried his hardest to rally his supporters, he made 
several critical mistakes that doomed the PLM struggle. Perhaps fearing politi¬ 
cal persecution if he returned to the centers of the 1906 and 1908 uprisings, 
he remained in California rather than going back to Texas, where many Mexican 
revolutionary leaders w ere congregating. As well, several critics, such as Antonio 
Villarreal and the French anarchist journal Les Temps Nouveaux , would later criti¬ 
cize him for remaining in the U.S. rather than moving to Mexico to personally 
lead the insurgency." 1 Auuitionaiiy, Magon s three years imprisonment and the 
persecution of the other PLM leaders had taken its toll on the PLM as a whole. 
The organization was severely debilitated by its lack of organization and poor 
administration. Arrests and executions had drastically reduced its membership, 
and government infiltration had fractured its network of cells. 
</p>

<p>
Despite this organizational weakness, PLM groups initiated struggles 
against Diaz in several Mexican states. On June 26 in Bernardino Contla, Tlaxcala, 
300 campesinos took over the town hall and arrested the political boss in the 
name of the PLM, but the army soon suppressed the uprising. Along the U.S.- 
Mexico border and in the state ofVeracruz, PLM groups had been consistently cor¬ 
responding with the Junta leaders and planning uprisings. On October 17,1910, 
Santana Rodriguez Palafox, or “Santanona former bandit leader who converted

to liberalism, tried to capture San Andres Tuxtla, a city near the capital of Veracruz. 
However, he and his 59 troops were defeated by a rural police force and Santanon 
was mortally wounded. 
</p>

<p>
On December 9, Praxedis Guerrero, the tireless PLM organizer, its most 
capable military leader, and one of its most poetic voices, went to El Paso, Tex¬ 
as to organize the veterans of the Las Vacas and Palomas attacks for a new as¬ 
sault on Chihuahua. They entered Mexico, commandeering trains and blowing 
up bridges. They continued recruiting soldiers and captured the village of Cor- 
ralitos. Guerrero telephoned the town of Casas Grandes, ordering it to surrender 
immediately. After taking the village of Janos on December 29, federal troops ar¬ 
rived from Casas Grandes, driving out the PLM rebels and murdering Guerrero. 
</p>

<p>
BAJA CALIFORNIA 
</p>

<p>
Amidst its long history of failures, the PLM achieved one major success 
in the Mexican Revolution. It inaugurated a significant military campaign in the 
Mexican state of Baja California.The Junta had a number of reasons for choosing 
this target. Because it was relatively close to Los Angeles, Flores Magon and his 
cohorts could more easily coordinate an attack. As this territory was sparsely 
populated and contained few federal troops, the liberal movement, even in its 
weakened state, had a good chance of succeeding. Flores Magon also believed 
that the Baja peninsula had great strategic importance as a base for future attacks 
on the Mexican mainland. 
</p>

<p>
Ricardo Flores Magon demonstrated his understanding of the interna¬ 
tional struggle against exploitation by inviting non-Mexican fighters to join in 
the Baja campaign. Lacking sufficient Mexican troops, especially ones with much 
military experience,the PLM turned to U.S. radicals for help. Flores Magon urged 
his supporters in Los Angeles and throughout Southern California to take up arms 
with the PLM. Asserting that all workers share the same struggle against author¬ 
ity and capitalism, he explained that one did not need to have Mexican blood 
to fight for the liberation of Mexico. In a manifesto directed to the Industrial 
Workers of the World, Flores Magon described the Mexican Revolution as the 
first stage in smashing tyranny and exploitation worldwide.The manifesto stated, 
“This formidable struggle of the two social classes in Mexico is the first act in 
the great universal tragedy which very soon will break upon the scene all over 
the planet, and whose final act will be the triumph of the magnanimous formula 
of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity which the bourgeois political revolutions have not 
been able to translate into physical reality, because these revolutions have not

<p>
dared to break to pieces the dorsal spine of tyranny: capitalism and authoritarian¬ 
ism. &#x2026; Our cause is your cause. If you remain inactive when your brothers go to 
their deaths clutching the red flag, you’ll give, through your inaction, a rude blow 
to the proletarian cause.” 92 
</p>

<p>
In response to this call, the IWW and John Kenneth Turner gathered 
arms and ammunition and smuggled them to Mexico every way possible. Of the 
500 soldiers assembled for the battle, about one-fifth were IWW members. Many 
IJ.S. socialists and members of unions such as the AFL and the WFM joined the 
struggle. So did several soldiers of fortune and drifters. From Europe, several Ital¬ 
ian and Spanish anarchists came to fight for Mexican liberation. PLM emissaries 
also enlisted local Baja Indians from the Tarahuma tribe to rise up with them. On 
January 29, 1911, the PLM army captured the border city of Mexicali. From there, 
it continued, taking the towns of Algodones andTecate. It eventually achieved a 
major victory by taking Tijuana. 
</p>

<p>
Unable to tolerate the international thrust of Flores Magon’s mission, vari¬ 
ous individuals used nationalistic arguments to discredit this struggle. U.S. And 
Mexican officials and newspapers spread the rumor that the motley crew of fight¬ 
ers was composed of mere “filibusters” (foreign mercenaries), fighting in Mexico 
to seize territory for the U.S. Los Angeles newspapers, especially the Los Angeles 
Times , published by H. G. Otis who owned the San Ysidro Ranch in Tijuana and 
land throughout Baja, denounced the combatants as traitors. He urged first Diaz 
then Madero to crush the rebellion that so greatly threatened his financial in¬ 
terests. Porfirio Diaz attacked the uprising as an invasion by foreigners. Madero 
likewise criticized the Baja fighters as “filibusters.” Using such propaganda, the 
Mexican Counsel in Los Angeles organized reactionary Mexicans to fight against

Although Flores Magon definitely did not w ant to seize Baja for Yankee 
capitalists or for the U.S. government, his struggle was embarrassed by the few 
who did.The Baja campaign attracted combatants with a variety of motives. Radi¬ 
cals who wanted to bring justice to the Mexican people or to foment world¬ 
wide anarchist revolution composed the vast majority of the PLM army. However, 
the struggle also attracted a few opportunists whose desires were not so noble. 
Some profiteers sold day passes to San Diego tourists who freely looted Mexican 
shops. Actor, charlatan, and adventurer Dick Ferris attempted to plant a banner in 
Tijuana declaring Baja to be an independent, U.S.-affiliated republic. Some have 
speculated that Ferris conducted his campaign at the behest of the Los Angeles 
Times publishers . 93 Similarly, soldier of fortune Carl Rhys Pryce stole funds from

the PLM struggle and tried to claim the land for the British Empire. Impelled by 
the propaganda of the Mexican government and suspicious of the odd assort¬ 
ment of individuals in the PLM army, some of Baja’s local population began to 
fight against their liberators in June 1911. Soon afterwards, Madero sent a bri¬ 
gade of federal troops inherited from Diaz—rather than revolutionary soldiers 
who might have refuse to fight, or might even join, the PLM—to capture Tijuana, 
thereby cementing his rule over the Mexican nation. 
</p>

<p>
PLM BETRAYED BY MADERO AND U.S. LABOR AND SOCIALISTS 
</p>

<p>
Madero’s defeat of the PLM in Baja represented the culminating stage in 
the war between these two philosophically opposed camps and put an end to 
Flores Magon’s hopes for military success in the Mexican Revolution. The two 
men had a long history. Madero had originally supported Flores Magon and other 
Junta leaders when they were first exiled to the U.S. in 1904. However, as Flores 
Magon’s views became more radical and as he called for social and economic 
change, Madero and other moderate, wealthy liberals withdrew their support. In 
1906, Madero, a committed vegetarian and spiritualist, repudiated Flores Magon’s 
call for revolution, stating that it would be a “crime to stain the fatherland in 
blood.” 94 Ironically, he himself was now leading the military struggle. In Septem¬ 
ber 1910, barely two months before he inaugurated his battle, Madero, realizing 
the strength of the PLM along the border, sent a representative to Los Angeles 
asking Ricardo to support his election and to work with him to unseat Diaz. In 
return, a contemptuous Flores Magon demanded money from the privileged aris¬ 
tocrat to fund the PLM struggle. Madero refused and Flores Magon denounced 
him. After Diaz fled for Europe on May 25, 1911, soon-to-be President Madero 
approached Flores Magon to offer him the vice-presidency. Ricardo rebuffed this 
request by making the counteroffer that all revolutionary leaders should direct 
Mexico together until peace was finally established. Again, Madero refused. 95 
</p>

<p>
Flores Magon adamantly rejected Madero’s grab for power. From the be¬ 
ginning of the revolution, he repeatedly attacked the Coahuilan aristocrat in all 
possible forums. In the pages of Regeneration, Flores Magon criticized the per- 
sonalismo , the cult of personality, behind Madero and other revolutionary lead¬ 
ers. He emphasized that the Mexican workers and peasants must not rally behind 
a leader. Instead, as the sole creators of wealth, they must make the revolution 
themselves for their own well-being. In a circular, Flores Magon criticized Madero 
for fighting for only political liberty, whereas the PLM desired to expropriate plan¬ 
tations and factories and distribute them to the Mexican populace. In Regener-

<p>
acion, he asserted that, by only forwarding a reformist plan of “effective suffrage” 
and “no-reelection,” Madero remained an advocate of the capitalist exploitation 
that oppressed the Mexican people. 
</p>

<p>
Although events in the Mexican Revolution would prove Flores Magon’s 
analysis to be fundamentally correct, much of the U.S.left abandoned him in favor 
of Madero. Leftists in the U.S. Agreed that Porfirio Diaz was a tyrant, but did not 
clearly understand the political situation in Mexico. As well, many were them¬ 
selves too reformist to dare to dream the anarchist vision of Ricardo Flores Magon. 
Many powerful labor leaders among the Junta s former supporters withdrew their 
endorsements of the PLM. On March 11, 1911, Flores Magon solicited aid from 
Samuel Gompers, president of the American Federation of Labor. However, Gomp- 
ers, wary of Flores Magon’s radicalism, refused to provide any support until the 
PLM clearly articulated its revolutionary agenda to him. In any case, theAFL was 
already planning to establish labor deals with the Madero regime. 96 Mother Jones, 
a key organizer of the United Mine Workers and the Western Federation of Miners, 
traveled to Mexico where Madero gave her the right to organize Mexican min¬ 
ers. When she returned in October 1911 to speak to Flores Magon, she ardently 
praised Madero. She asked Flores Magon to return to Mexico and make peace with 
him. A shocked, hostile Flores Magon proudly stated that he refused to betray his 
disinherited brothers. In turn, Mother Jones denounced him as an unreasonable 
fanatic. 97 
</p>

<p>
Not only the labor movement, but also the socialist movement became 
alienated from Flores Magon .The anarchist Lone of his Mamtesto to the Workers of 
the World drove many away. A socialist group in Los Angeles asked Ricardo to state 
clearly his political views. Although he hemmed and hawed, questioning why one 
would argue over “isms, ” Fiores Magon couid not conceal his libertarian ideals. In a 
July 1911 International Socialist Review essay, the socialist leader Eugene V Debs 
proclaimed distinctly,“Reading between the lines I can see nothing but anarchism 
in this program.” 98 Indeed, Debs doubted that such a total social and economic 
revolution would ever succeed in Mexico. Arguing that Mexicans were not class 
conscious, he promoted a program of political reform that would gradually pro¬ 
pel the nation towards socialism. Even though Debs criticized the PLM ideology, 
he still spoke out against the unjust persecution of the PLM. In contrast, certain 
other socialists were downright vicious. The New York Call openly attacked the 
anarchist Junta leaders. It mocked Flores Magon for remaining secure in his Los 
Angeles newspaper office rather than personally joining the fight in Baja. 
</p>


<p>

</p>




<p>
In the wake of so much abandonment by labor leaders and socialists, 
only anarchists rallied to Ricardo Flores Magon’s cause. The Manifesto to the 
Workers of the World that had alienated so many socialists attracted many in 
the syndicalist IWW with its proclamation of the Mexican Revolution as the first 
act of the international uprising of the disinherited. Influential Russian-American 
anarchists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman spoke and wrote articles en¬ 
dorsing the PLM and Flores Magon’s critique of Madero.Voltairine de Cleyre also 
contributed to these issues as the newspaper’s Chicago correspondent. She con¬ 
tinued to speak and solicit funds for the PLM, but her vigorous efforts were cut 
short by her untimely death on June 20, 1912. British anarchist William C. Owen 
became the editor of the English-language page of Regeneration. Owen attacked 
socialists for deserting Flores Magon. Goldman similarly allowed Flores Magon to 
defend himself in issues of her magazine, Mother Earth. She excoriated socialists 
for abandoning his cause, calling the attitude of the Socialist Party towards the 
Mexican Revolution “an attitude so cowardly, contemptible, and disgusting as to 
deserve the severest chastisement by the entire international revolutionary prole¬ 
tariat. Not enough that the party leaders ridicule and slander the rebels of Mexico, 
but they are actively playing into the hands of capitalism by their treachery to 
the brave fighters for Mexican liberty.” 99 In addition to defending stridently the 
PLM’s engagement in the Mexican Revolution, anarchists supported Junta leaders 
most fervently when they were sent to prison. Owen rallied people to fight for 
the liberation of these martyrs of McNeil Island. Goldman continued to remind 
readers and audiences of these class war convicts. 
</p>

<p>
Although anarchists generally agreed with Flores Magon’s political views, 
several criticized him harshly for his tactical decisions. Some of the Italian anar¬ 
chists who had fought in Baja California complained that the campaign was not 
clearly guided by any anarchist principles. They further chastised Flores Magon 
for failing to join the troops on the peninsula. The prominent French anarchist 
publication Les Temps Nouveaux (“NewTimes”) echoed this complaint, attack¬ 
ing Flores Magon for not personally leading the military campaign in Baja. Simi¬ 
larly, the paper attacked him because he did not clearly and unequivocally declare 
the anarchist nature of his struggle. Most seriously, the journal accused him of 
misusing donations to foment factionalism. In response, the Russian anarchist 
Peter Kropotkin wrote a letter to the journal, roundly condemning it for abandon¬ 
ing Ricardo Flores Magon. Goldman and Owen also spoke out in his defense. 
</p>

<p>
Flores Magon’s struggle was also debilitated by the defection of many 
PLM members, including several Junta leaders. In the pages of Regeneration , 
</p>


<p>

</p>




<p>
Flores Magon warned against moderates blunting the impact of the Mexican 
Revolution. He urged fighters not to support Madero, for he would only bring 
political reform and would leave intact the oppressive structure of capitalism. 
Conversely, the PLM would fight for the working class and expropriate the land 
for the people. However, by the time the Mexican revolution broke out, Flores 
Magon had been so secretive about his anarchism that many Mexicans had not 
clearly distinguished his goals from reformist ones. Many PLM members did not 
plainly understand the differences between Flores Magon and Madero.The chaos 
of the Revolution prevented them from receiving issues of Regeneration that 
would have clarified this distinction. 
</p>

<p>
Many people only saw that Madero—like Flores Magon—was fighting to 
overthrow Porfirio Diaz. Because Madero possessed the most powerful armies, 
they decided to join his struggle. Aquiles Serdan, whose father had been assas¬ 
sinated by the dictatorship for being an anarchist activist, probably held views 
as radical as Flores Magon’s. Nevertheless, he fought for Madero, whose move¬ 
ment was stronger in his state, Puebla. 100 Madero exploited Mexicans’ confusion 
by pretending that he was working together with the PLM. Even though there 
were many battles between Madero s supporters and the PLM’s, rumors spread 
that they had joined together. More insidiously, Madero published and distributed 
a manifesto listing him as president and Flores Magon as vice-president. Many PLM 
members were fooled and enlisted as his soldiers. 
</p>

<p>
In addition to this desertion by many naive PLM troops, certain key mem¬ 
bers of the Junta broke with Flores Magon for more ideological reasons.Through¬ 
out his political career, Ricardo Flores Magon alienated many of his former com¬ 
rades and supporters. One gets the impression that he was so driven by his radical 
vision for human liberation that lie repeatedly estranged himself from people 
with more moderate views. He had broken with the reformist Liberal Party found¬ 
er Camilo Arriaga in 1905. While he was imprisoned in Los Angeles, he began to 
have disagreements with other prominent Junta leaders. As mentioned above, he 
wrote to Praxedis Guerrero and his brother Enrique on June 13, 1908, instruct¬ 
ing them to conceal the anarchist nature of his revolutionary plans from Manuel 
Sarabia and Antonio I. Villarreal, because they would not be radical enough to ac¬ 
cept it. His partisanship became even more explicit in an October 1908 letter to 
his common-law wife’s daughter, Lucia Norman. He wrote,“Antonio is no longer a 
member of the Junta, and shortly Manuel will not be either” 101 
</p>

<p>
Not only philosophical differences, but also pragmatic considerations 
prompted several Junta leaders to part ways with Flores Magon. Juan Sarabia, 
</p>


<p>

</p>




<p>
Manuel Sarabia, and Antonio I. Villarreal all hoped to be involved personally in 
the rebuilding of Mexico after Diaz’s ouster. They realized that they would have 
to abandon Flores Magon for the victorious Madero if they wanted any influ¬ 
ence over that process. After Madero freed Juan Sarabia from the Mexican prison 
San Juan de Ulua, Sarabia wrote an open letter to the socialist New York Call 
denouncing Ricardo for forcing anarchism on Mexico. He further claimed that 
Flores Magon’s politics were too personal, and that he was too moody and too 
unstable to be an authentic revolutionary. Similarly, Sarabia’s cousin Manuel wrote 
an article denouncing Ricardo for being too authoritarian a leader. 
</p>

<p>
On a February evening in 1911, Antonio I. Villarreal and Ricardo Flores 
Magon discussed the Mexican Revolution at the Turners’home in Los Angeles. As 
the discussion progressed, their disagreements became more heated and they 
soon began denouncing each other. After a few minutes, an enraged Villarreal 
leapt to his feet, put on his hat, raced down the stairs, and stormed out of the 
house to join Madero’s movement. 102 Once in Mexico, Villarreal published nas¬ 
ty articles denouncing Flores Magon for not actively fighting in the revolution. 
He further insulted him as a “blackguard, swindler, coward and degenerate” who 
“shared his mistress with all men of bad taste .’’Villarreal challenged Flores Magon 
to a fight, saying “if I capture him, I will spit in his face and send him to a mad¬ 
house.” 103 
</p>

<p>
Rather than trying to restore any sense of dignity to these squabbles, 
Flores Magon’s responses sustained the baseness of this partisan conflict. In an 
open letter in the July 2,1911 issue of Regeneration, he denounced Juan Sarabia 
as a Judas who had sacrificed the welfare of the humble people of Mexico for the 
gold of Madero. Even more savagely, he heaped accusations upon Villarreal, calling 
him an assassin and a homosexual with a particular penchant for young boys. 104 
</p>

<p>
In addition to the vicious denunciations by former comrades who had 
left him for Madero, Madero himself employed a number of treacherous tactics to 
undermine Flores Magon’s revolutionary efforts. During February 1911, Madero 
entered Mexico from his exile in Texas. He tried to capture Zaragoza, Chihuahua, 
but soon became lost and confused in the harsh desert. He asked PLM general 
Prisciliano Silva, who had recently seized nearby Guadalupe, for help and for 
troops. Silva sent emissaries and food to assist Madero. Silva’s lieutenant Lazaro 
Gutierrez de Lara also arrived in Guadalupe with reinforcements from the bor¬ 
der. When Madero came with his troops to meet them, he arrogantly demanded 
that the two men and their armies join his forces. Gutierrez de Lara, a socialist, 
</p>


<p>

</p>




<p>
joined Madero’s cause. When Silva refused to betray his principles, Madero ar¬ 
rested him. 
</p>

<p>
Madero not only undermined the PLM’s military efforts, he used several 
underhanded schemes to attack Flores Magon personally. On June 13,1911, Made¬ 
ro sent Juan Sarabia and Ricardo’s own brother, the lawyer Jesus Flores Magon, 
to negotiate a peace with Ricardo and Enrique. The two emissaries asked them 
to terminate the PLM’s independent struggle, to join forces with Madero, and to 
end the conflict in Baja. Enrique exploded with rage, and Ricardo flatly rejected 
their proposal. According to Ricardo, Sarabia then threatened them “If you do not 
cooperate with us, / will do all the harm that is possible .” 1(,s Indeed, Madero 
had already indicated to U.S. Authorities that he approved of the apprehension of 
Ricardo Flores Magon. By this time, the U.S. government wanted to eliminate anar¬ 
chism by apprehending or exiling all anarchist leaders such as Flores Magon and 
to shut down all anarchist media outlets such as Regeneration." *’ The day after 
Juan Sarabia and Jesus Flores Magon’s visit, U.S. Authorities raided the offices of 
the paper, arresting Ricardo Flores Magon, Enrique Flores Magon, Librado Rivera, 
and Anselmo L. Figueroa on seven counts of violating the neutrality laws in Baja. 
</p>

<p>
To add insult to injury, Madero’s supporters co-opted the radical mes¬ 
sage of Ricardo Flores Magon in a most dramatic way. A few of Flores Magon’s 
former collaborators in the liberal party and the PLM, such as Juan Sarabia, Anto¬ 
nio I. Villarreal, Jesus Flores Magon, and Camilo Arriaga, published a newspaper 
entitled Regeneration in Mexico City during August 1911This paper, which Ri¬ 
cardo mocked as “Degencraci6n,”did not last long. Nevertheless, it indicated that 
Madero still needed to claim the legacy of Ricardo Flores Magon to forward his 
own agenda.This process of appropriating a radical tradition to forward a moder¬ 
ate, even conservative, agenda was repeated throughout the Mexican revolution. 
It is still being perpetuated in Mexico today. 
</p>

<p>
MANIFESTO OF SEPTEMBER 23, 1911 
</p>

<p>
Reacting to the many attacks on the PLM, Ricardo Flores Magon issued 
the radical Manifesto of the Organizing Junta of the Mexican Liberal Party on 
September 23, 1911. Thousands of copies were distributed throughout Mexico. 
For too long, the PLM had been fighting under the banner of the 1906 Program. 
Because this document proposed only making reforms to the government, many 
PLM members mistakenly associated their party’s goals with the moderate aims 
of Madero.The French anarchist journal Les Temps Nouveaux, among others, had 
criticized Flores Magon for employing this document instead of one that more

<p>
clearly proclaimed his anarchism. By authoring the Manifesto of 23 September 
1911, Flores Magon seems to have been trying to answer his critics and to stake 
out the most radical position for Mexico’s revolutionary future. Yet, even in this 
document whose concepts are unmistakably anarchist-communist, Flores Magon, 
perhaps concerned about intimidating his potential audience, refrained from us¬ 
ing the word “anarchism.” 
</p>

<p>
In the Manifesto of September 23, 1911, Flores Magon and the other 
PLM spokesmen laid out a remarkable vision for a utopian future. They began by 
explaining how the institution of private property is the source of all inequality 
and therefore the cause of all injustice and human misery.The Manifesto began, 
“The Organizing Junta of the Partido Liberal Mexicano views with sympathy your 
efforts to put into practice the lofty ideals of political, economic, and social eman¬ 
cipation, whose reign upon the earth will finally put an end to the long battle 
of man against man, which has its origin in the inequality of wealth born of the 
principle of private property.” 107 The Manifesto vowed to annihilate all the in¬ 
stitutions that serve to protect that principle: the exploitation of capitalism, the 
tyranny of government, and the manipulation of the church. As the Manifesto 
declared, “The Partido Liberal Mexicano recognizes that Authority and the Clergy 
are the support for the iniquity of Capital, and therefore the Organizing Junta 
of the Partido Liberal Mexicano has declared solemn war upon Authority, Capi¬ 
tal, and the Clergy.” 108 With the overthrow of this three-headed beast, economic 
equality, political liberty, and peace between men would reign. Urging Mexicans 
not to support an individual leader or government, the manifesto exhorted them 
to take back the land and the industries that rightfully belong to the people, the 
sole producers of all wealth. 
</p>

<p>
Much of this document’s model for a future society was borrowed from 
Peter Kropotkin’s Fields, Factories and Workshops. Like this work, the Manifesto 
instructed revolutionaries to expropriate all property and to take a careful inven¬ 
tory of all produce and industrial goods. These resources would be distributed to 
all for survival until the next harvest. During this time, workers from each indus¬ 
try would meet with each other and with farmers to plan future production. Ag¬ 
ricultural produce and manufactured wares would then be deposited in huge 
storehouses from which all could take what they needed. 
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, Flores Magon issued the Manifesto too late in the Mexi¬ 
can Revolution to prevent the dissipation of his radical hopes. With Madero’s 
defeat of the PLM in Baja, the PLM military effort had essentially gasped its last 
breath. Around this time, Ricardo Flores Magon received positive attention from

<p>
an ally who could have greatly helped him realize his utopian dream. In the state 
of Morelos, Emiliano Zapata revolted against Madero because Madero would not 
do anything to restore lands stolen from the people. Zapata had been aware of 
Flores Magon’s crusade for a long time. He had first read Regeneration in 1905. 
Many PLM members and readers of its newspaper had joined his army. Addition¬ 
ally, delegates from the PLM visited him several times to discuss the revolution. 
Further, Zapata’s Plan de Alaya, which insisted on expropriating the land for the 
people, borrowed many ideas and phrases from the pages of Regeneration. In 
1912, Zapata offered Flores Magon and other PLM leaders the opportunity to 
move to his state of Morelos where they could freely publish and distribute their 
newspaper. Unfortunately, by the time he made this offer, these men were facing 
legal prosecution from the United States government. 
</p>

<p>
THE LAST TRIALS OF RICARDO FLORES MAGON 
</p>


<p>
The Mexican Revolution finally achieved the goal that Ricardo Flores 
Magon had envisioned over a decade before in Mexico City: at last, the dictator 
Porfirio Diaz had fled the country. However, the revolution fell far short of the 
ideals that Ricardo now dreamed. In stark contrast to his hopes for social and 
economic justice for all people, the revolution seemed only to strive for political 
reforms, leaving the oppression of capitalism fully intact. The privileged Madero 
refused to redistribute land to the virtually enslaved populace of Mexico. Addi¬ 
tionally, because Madero’s prominent family was close to a number of Diaz’s min¬ 
isters, especially the powerful cientifico leader Jose Limantour, his government 
retained many corrupt officials from the previous regime. Among the revolution¬ 
ary chieftains, only Emiliano Zapata remained loyal to the impoverished masses of 
Mexico, fighting to restore land stolen from them by local aristocrats and foreign 
capitalists. Not only did the aims of the Mexican Revolution fall short of Flores 
Magon’s hopes, but its fundamental orientation was deeply misguided.The masses 
of Mexico were tricked again and again into the mystique of personalismo, the 
cult of personality, choosing to follow one leader or another rather than fighting 
for their own liberation. In Flores Magon’s opinion, the generals were creating a 
Mexico that would be fundamentally authoritarian and bourgeois-capitalist rather 
than anarchist and communist as it should be. 
</p>

<p>
After the PLM’s failure in Baja, it could no longer muster sufficient military 
force to fight for the liberation of all Mexicans. Although Porfirio Diaz had worried 
about Flores Magon’s threats to his dictatorship, the corrupt, bourgeois leaders of

<p>

</p>




<p>
the new regime were no longer concerned about his movement. Perhaps Flores 
Magon, who had regenerated the PLM struggle so many times before, could have 
established a significant anarchist-communist presence in the following years of 
the revolution. However, legal problems in his country of exile prevented him 
from doing much of anything. Whereas Mexico’s chieftains no longer worried 
about Flores Magon’s radical dream, the U.S. government forcefully repressed his 
passionate voice of dissent. 
</p>

<p>
THE TRIAL OF 1912 
</p>

<p>
The U.S. intended to suppress the PLM’s radicalism through its June 
1912 trial of Ricardo and Enrique Flores Magon, Librado Rivera, and Anselmo L. 
Figueroa. At the time that the four were apprehended, the political situation in 
Los Angeles and around Southern California was quite volatile. On June 1, 1910, 
metal workers in Los Angeles went on strike for the right to unionize. Harrison 
Gray Otis, the reactionary publisher of the Los Angeles Times, used his paper 
as a forum to attack these labor struggles. Several months later, the offices of 
the newspaper were bombed, killing and injuring many innocent workers. Six 
months later, two union officials were charged with the crime, casting a long 
shadow upon radical movements. In addition to this tension in Los Angeles, mem¬ 
bers of the IWW—many of whom had fought with the PLM in Baja—were dra¬ 
matically confronting the authorities in San Diego. In an attempt to clean up the 
business district, San Diego police were attempting to suppress IWW orators 
who railed against the evils of government, god, and capitalism. In reaction to 
the city council’s January 8, 1912 ordinance that prohibited all public speeches 
downtown, IWW members flocked to San Diego to protest and to clog up the 
courts. Alarmed by the massive influx of itinerant radicals, groups of San Diego 
citizens—often organized by business interests—formed vigilante groups which, 
working with local police, viciously beat the IWW out of their city. One group 
kidnapped Emma Goldman’s lover, the bold and flamboyant Ben Reitman, using 
cigars to burn “IWW” in his buttocks, twisting his genitals, and covering his body 
with tar and sagebrush. 
</p>

<p>
To confront the U.S. government’s determination to quash leftist move¬ 
ments and to imprison anarchists, many radicals protested the arrests of the PLM 
spokesmen.The Turners and the IWW organized rallies and coordinated support. 
Emma Goldman sent copies of Regeneracion and The Manifesto to the Workers 
of the World to sympathizers around the globe, soliciting their help. A Chicago 
support group contributed funds for the PLM defense and sent letters to Washing-

<p>
ton, DC. It also organized international support in England and Canada. In the U.S., 
many immigrant and U.S.-born Mexicans rallied around the imprisoned Junta lead¬ 
ers. Ricardo Flores Magon’s wife and daughter spoke out at Los Angeles’ very first 
public square, the Placita de Los Angeles, a popular site for Mexicans and Mexican- 
Americans to proclaim their views during the early history of Los Angeles. These 
speeches motivated crowds to attend the June 1912 trial of the persecuted Junta 
leaders. 
</p>

<p>
Radicals boldly pronounced their support for the PLM at the Los Angeles 
trail.The courtroom was filled with Mexican, Mexican-American, and white radi¬ 
cals wearing red and black to display their solidarity. Vocal women wore banners 
proclaiming anarchist slogans across their breasts. Men also declared their anar¬ 
chism and derided the U.S. flag. Every day, supporters outside the court clashed 
with police. 109 The U.S. used a number of devious tactics to convict the Junta lead¬ 
ers. It manufactured witnesses and utilized spies from the Mexican government. 
Government agents arrested most defense witnesses before they could appear in 
court. Attorneys also intimidated and bribed participants in the Baja revolution 
for their false testimony. They offered a $200 base payment plus $5 a day to Baja 
fighters for their perjury, and offered to drop whatever previous legal indictments 
they may have been facing. Flores Magon’s adopted daughter Lucia grew so out¬ 
raged that she interrupted one of one witness’s many lies to slap him across the 
face. Even more dramatically, the prosecution’s key witness Jack Mosby, an IWW 
member and a general in Baja, bravely asserted his radical beliefs and denounced 
the treachery of the corrupt prosecution when called to the stand. Despite this 
heroic act, the court found Ricardo Flores Magon and the other defendants guilty 
and sentenced them to 23 months imprisonment at the federal penitentiary in 
iviclscii island, wiisiiingion. 
</p>

<p>
This miscarriage of justice sparked one of the wildest riots in Los Angeles 
history. 110 Thousands of radicals demonstrated in front of the jail and courthouse 
chanting “Down with Taft and the USA.” Magon’s daughter Lucia led a group of 
over 2000 men and women to follow the guards who were taking the convicts to 
a county jail. Hundreds of policemen attacked this crowd. They beat down pro¬ 
testers for over an hour, arresting many. Authorities later claimed that the protest 
was an effort to free the prisoners.

<p>
and Southern California greeted them. Even though most of their supporters 
were terribly poor, they still managed to raise some money at these fundraisers. 
However, the military possibilities for a PLM revolution had been demolished by 
this time. Many fighters had been arrested or killed or died in prison. Many oth¬ 
ers had joined the forces of Madero or another leader. With no other prospects, 
Flores Magon returned to the role he knew best: the publisher of the newspaper 
Regeneration. While the paper had appeared sporadically under the editorship 
of Antonio P. Araujo while Flores Magon was in jail, it had not come out on any 
consistent basis. 
</p>

<p>
In the first issue the Junta spokesmen published on January 31, 1914, 
they vowed yet again to continue their fight. By this time, Madero had been ex¬ 
ecuted, but new bourgeois, reactionary “revolutionary” leaders such asVictoriano 
Huerta andVenustiano Carranza had taken his place. Regeneration opposed each 
new figure, typically employing the same arguments it had used against Madero. 
In late 1914 or early 1915,Ricardo,his brother Enrique, his wife Maria,her daugh¬ 
ter Lucia, Librado Rivera, and several others founded a communal five-and-half 
acre farm at Edendale, known today as “Echo Park,” in northeastern Los Angeles. 
Here they put into practice their anarchist ideals, living and working commu¬ 
nally, growing vegetables and publishing their newspaper. Ricardo toured the area 
speaking about the Mexican revolution, his experiences, and his dreams for an 
anarchist utopia. He also extended the literary forms of anarchist discourse by 
writing plays and didactic stores for children and uneducated peasants. 111 
</p>

<p>
In all venues, Ricardo spoke and wrote vigorously against the Mexican 
tendency towards personalismo, the act of identifying a movement of liberation 
with a certain individual.To prevent the U.S. And Mexican PLM from dividing into 
different factions, he asserted that PLM members must not follow any leader, but 
instead must fight together for the social and economic liberation of all.When Ve- 
nustiano Carranza took control of Mexico, Flores Magon exhorted his readers not 
to follow him, but to continue their expropriation of the land. Anarchists such as 
Emma Goldman supported his analysis of the Mexican Revolution as well as his 
desire for a worldwide social and economic revolution. 
</p>

<p>
In the April 1915 issue of her journal Mother Earth , Goldman published 
Ricardo’s “Manifesto to the Workers of the United States.”This prophetic docu¬ 
ment foresaw many of the ultimate effects of global capitalism and of trade ac¬ 
cords like NAFTA and the FTAA. Warning that wage slavery does not recognize 
national borders, the Manifesto urged all to struggle in solidarity against hunger 
and poverty. It stated, “To deny solidarity to the Mexican workingmen who are

<p>
struggling to conquer their economic freedom is to stand against the Labor cause 
in general, because the cause of the wage-slave against his master has no fron¬ 
tiers "The Manifesto explained that a Mexico controlled by a government rather 
than the people would flood the U.S. with cheap labor, lowering wages. It further 
warned that U.S. companies would relocate their factories below the border.“The 
wealth of the magnates of American industry will flow into Mexico, for all the ad¬ 
venturers and all the exploiters; the manufacturers of the United States would be 
transplanted to Mexico, that would become an ideal land for business because of 
the cheapness of salaries, and the American workingmen will find their factories 
and firms in this country closed down because it will be more profitable to their 
bosses to open their business where they will pay twenty-five to fifty cents a day 
for the same kind of work for which they would have to pay two or three dollars 
a day in this country 2 
</p>

<p>
While anarchists understood Flores Magon’s prophetic message, many 
other leftists believed that he was jealous that another individual was now rul¬ 
ing Mexico. Just like Francisco I. Madero had done years before, President Venus- 
tiano Carranza duped many U.S. labor and socialist leaders with false promises of 
reform. After Carranza allowed AFL president Samuel Gompers to make strategic 
alliances with Mexican labor, the union leader wrote President Woodrow Wilson 
declaring Carranza a friend of labor and democracy. Even John Kenneth Turner, 
one of the few who had defended Flores Magon against Madero, claimed that 
Carranza’s regime was a victory for socialism and labor. Similarly, within Mexico, 
many people, including many PLM members, were tired of four years of bloody 
fighting and supported the new president. 
</p>

<p>
Carranza cleverly manipulated unions into supporting his regime. His 
government implemented several labor reforms, most of which were taken di¬ 
rectly from the 1906 PLM manifesto. He legalized unions, increased wages, limited 
working hours, and decreed Sunday as a day off. Carranza allowed the anarcho- 
syndicalist Casa del Obrero Mundial to organize Mexican labor and even granted 
it the use of a former Jesuit convent. Tragically, the Casa returned the favor by 
drafting working-class men into “Red Battalions” to fight as soldiers of Carranza 
against the armies of Zapata, the defender of agrarian peasants. As before, Flores 
Magon saw through the reforms that naive unionists and socialists embraced. Six 
months after Carranza came to power, he ruled that it would be treason to strike 
against government interests and began cracking down on unions. On August 1, 
1916, he signed a law threatening striking workers with the death penalty and 
</p>


<p>

</p>




<p>
brutally repressed on charges of “rebellion” a general strike called by the Casa del 
Obrero Mundial. 113 
</p>

<p>
The U.S. government refused to tolerate Flores Magon’s condemnation 
of Carranza and Magon’s other radical statements, in part because business and 
political leaders were eager to establish normal working relations with the new 
Mexican president. Carranza further leveraged his influence by exploiting racial 
tensions against Ricardo Flores Magon. Economic tensions in both the white and 
Mexican populations in several Texas counties along the Mexican border had 
been polarizing both of these groups. This soon erupted into violence: In the 
tumult of the Mexican revolution, bandits were crossing into Texas to execute 
border raids. White Texas rangers and vigilante groups reacted by freely attack¬ 
ing Mexicans and other ethnic groups living in the United States. In turn, these 
oppressed people responded with similar violence. Amidst this chaos, a dissident 
group published a document called the “Plan de San Diego.” This manifesto de¬ 
clared that immigrants should fight to retake the former Mexican territories of 
Texas,Arizona, New Mexico, and Southern California. In this land, they would es¬ 
tablish an independent territory that would eventually rejoin the rest of Mexico. 
Later versions of the document encouraged blacks and Japanese to join in the 
struggle against the Yankee oppressor. 
</p>

<p>
Carranza complained to the U.S. government and postal service that Re¬ 
generation was creating disruptions along the border, prompting Mexicans and 
Mexican-Americans to revolt against his rule. He further accused Flores Magon 
of being behind the raids on U.S. territory and of conspiring to create the Plan 
de San Diego. Several conservative newspapers, such as The Los Angeles Times , 
spread these rumors that the PLM was scheming to retake Mexican territory. In¬ 
deed, certain authors of the Plan de San Diego may very well have been inspired 
by Regeneration and other PLM propaganda. In the midst of their anti-imperial¬ 
ist yet nationalist declarations, they employed anarchist terminology that urged 
the “proletariat” to “expropriate” the land. 114 One member of the group, Aniceto 
Pizana, had met Flores Magon in Laredo in 1904. He had been organizing local 
PLM cells before vigilante brutality drove him to join the San Diego group. 
</p>

<p>
As an internationalist, Flores Magon was at best ambivalent towards the 
Plan. He declared that it was a “hoax” invented by the bourgeois press to distract 
people from the racial injustice that was the true source of the violence. Howev¬ 
er, Flores Magon used extremely incendiary rhetoric to decry the brutality of the 
Texas Rangers. He asserted, “Justice, not gunshots, is what should be given to the 
revolutionaries in Texas. And, of course, everyone should demand that these per- 
</p>


<p>

<p>
secutions of innocent Mexicans should cease and, in regard to the revolutionaries, 
we should also demand that they not be shot &#x2026;Those who should be shot are the 
rangers and the mob of bandits who accompany them on their depredations. 115 
Already concerned that the PLM might be responsible for the Plan de San Diego, 
government officials soon became convinced that Flores Magon intended to in¬ 
cite an insurrection against the United States. 
</p>

<p>
THE TRIAL OF 1916 
</p>

<p>
Flores Magons insults to Carranza and his advocacy of decent treatment 
for Mexican-Americans again landed him in a U.S. court again. Ricardo Flores 
Magon had long known that the U.S. Post Office was monitoring him. A few 
weeks before his arrest, a postal inspector had requested copies of the September 
and October 1915 issues of Regeneration. On February 18, 1916, Ricardo Flores 
Magon, Enrique Flores Magon, and William C. Owen were indicted for defama¬ 
tion of character and for sending indecent materials through the mail, a violation 
of article 211 of the 1910 penal code. In particular, the U.S. government reacted 
against two articles by Ricardo that used inflammatory language to attack Car¬ 
ranza, as well the essay cited above that criticized the Texas rangers’ violence 
towards Mexicans. Not only did President Wilson fear Regeneration ’s poisoning 
of U.S. relations with Mexico, but he was also concerned that its radicalism might 
corrupt his Preparedness Campaign, a plan to send U.S. troops to fight in World 
War I. 
</p>

<p>
Ricardo and Enrique were apprehended on their Edendale commune. A 
policeman pistol whipped Enrique so severely that he had to be rushed to a hos¬ 
pital to stitch up his skull. Owen escaped, fleeing to Washington State. Soon af¬ 
ter their arrests, the U.S. Post Office also denied the publishers their fourth-class 
newspaper mailing privileges. 
</p>

<p>
As before, anarchists rallied to the aid of their Mexican comrades. In Los 
Angeles as well as other places, organizations such as the International Workers 
Defense League protested this persecution. William C. Owen decried Carranza 
as a lackey of Wilson who was only safeguarding the interests of U.S. capitalists 
in Mexico. Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman, who criticized Wilson as a 
lackey of Carranza, once again spoke out against the arrests at rallies, organized 
meetings to free the convicts, and wrote against the injustice in their papers, 
Mother Earth and The Blast. Goldman and Berkman further linked these arrests 
to the U.S. government’s repression of all radicals. After several bombings and the 
discovery of various bomb plots, the frightened U.S. government had stepped up 
</p>


<p>

</p>




<p>
its attacks on anarchists. A few months previously, Goldman herself had been 
arrested. Also, the ninth and tenth issues of Berkman’s The Blast had been pulled 
from the mails for printing Goldman’s “indecent” articles on birth control . 116 
</p>

<p>
In this repressive environment, the courts stridently attacked anarchism 
and anarchists. Courtroom observers were thoroughly searched for weapons.The 
prosecuting U.S. Attorney, Mansel G. Gallaher, directly insulted the ideals of anar¬ 
chism, claiming it was tantamount to violence. He argued that the Flores Magon 
brothers were advocates of murder who were a threat to the nation. According to 
him, they were merely leeching off of poor people with their false revolutionary 
promises. Additionally, the judge in the case, Judge Trippet echoed the prosecu¬ 
tion’s argument by averring that the government must be able to protect itself. 
The brothers were found guilty on May 21. However, the judge sympathized with 
the poor health of Ricardo, who was so sick he could not even speak during the 
trial.Trippet sentenced Ricardo to a year and a day in prison, whereas his brother 
Enrique received three years. The judge set bail at the steep price of $3000 for 
Ricardo and $3000 for Enrique. Luckily, Emma Goldman was speaking against the 
First World War in Los Angeles at that time. Learning of the Flores Magon brothers’ 
fate, she declared that her visit would be a failure unless they were both released. 
She miraculously raised the necessary funds and, on June 26, secured their release 
on bond pending appeal. Ricardo published an article in Regeneracion thanking 
Goldman and Berkman for their numerous acts of anarchist solidarity. He then 
continued to speak against his persecution before the International Workers De¬ 
fense League and the Severance Club, a group of prominent Southern California 
liberals. 
</p>

<p>
THE TRIAL OF 1918 
</p>

<p>
Although Enrique eventually served his sentence once all appeals were 
rejected, Ricardo’s case never reached the court.While he was out on bail, Ricardo 
issued a statement that would land him in jail for the rest of his life. He believed 
that the outbreak ofWorldWar I indicated the downfall of the old society and that 
the Russian Revolution signaled the collapse of capitalism. On March 16, 1918, 
Ricardo Flores Magon and Librado Rivera published their Manifesto to the Mem¬ 
bers of the PLM, the Anarchists of the World, and the Workingmen in GeneraLThis 
document discussed the masses’ discontent with the repression of government 
and the exploitation of capitalism, beckoning the workers to overthrow their 
bourgeois masters. It declared that “the death of the old society is close” and that 
“the death of bourgeois society won’t be long in coming.” It summoned people to

<p>
struggle: “Comrades, the moment is solemn; this moment is the precursor of the 
greatest political and social cataclysm recorded in history: the insurrection of all 
peoples against existing social conditions” 117 Opposing the fights between work¬ 
ing class soldiers on the battlefields of Europe, Flores Magon exhorted revolution¬ 
aries around the world to rise up against the old order to inaugurate a society 
that would be truly free. He urged intellectuals to prepare the masses, but again 
warned them against supporting any leader or government. 
</p>

<p>
This statement profoundly alarmed the U.S. government. By 1917, the 
fighting of the Mexican Revolution had abated, so Flores Magon’s agitation no 
longer concerned Mexico’s president. However, U.S. officials worried that Flores 
Magon ’s passionate voice of dissent would impair the security of the United States. 
Furthermore, federal authorities feared that it would interfere with the country’s 
engagement in World War I. President Wilson was deeply concerned that a radical 
U.S. working class might undermine industrial production and military expan¬ 
sion. 
</p>

<p>
In much the same manner that George W. Bush has attempted to silence 
protest through the Patriot Act and other repressive measures, President Wilson 
embarked on a campaign to quash radicalism. In the media, he intimidated people 
with patriotic propaganda. In 1917, he signed the Espionage Act and the Trading 
with Enemies Act to suppress any and all possible voices of dissent. As a result, 
Emma Goldman and other anarchists were deported to Soviet Russia.The U.S.War 
Department further attacked “seditious” acts that might damage the nation’s “vital 
interests. Soldiers put down strikes and raided meetings of radicals and IWW 
offices. All protests against the war were suppressed, and demonstrators were 
arrested for disloyalty and for advocating anarchy. Thousands of dissenters were 
thrown behind bars. Socialist and anarchist newspapers were banned. 
</p>

<p>
As Mexicans, Ricardo Flores Magon and Librado Rivera had yet another 
strike against them. In 1917, the U.S. learned of the so-called Zimmerman telegram. 
In this document, the German government offered the Mexican government the 
return of its former territory in the U.S. in exchange for its aid in World War I. Al¬ 
though the PLM was definitely not involved in this scheme, this communication 
prompted U.S. Authorities to pay special attention to Mexican dissidents. 
</p>

<p>
For writing and distributing the Manifesto to the Members of the PLM, 
the Anarchists of the World and the Workingmen in General, Ricardo Flores Magon 
and Librado Rivera were indicted for violations of the Espionage Act on March 21, 
1918, less than a week after the Manifesto’s publication.The government accused 
the two of participating in a conspiracy to foment insubordination and disloyalty, 
</p>


<p>

</p>




<p>
and of obstructing the recruitment of soldiers. They were also arraigned for vio¬ 
lating the Trading with Enemies Act.This edict made it illegal to print any news 
item or editorial in a foreign language without first filing a translation.The U.S. 
postmaster, who had been monitoring Regeneration for a long time, averred that 
no translation had been received. Finally, the men were again charged with violat¬ 
ing section 211 of the 1910 penal code that made it illegal to distribute indecent 
materials through the mail. 
</p>

<p>
The government argued that the Manifesto’s declaration of the death of 
the old society would cause dissension among the working class. It feared that 
the document’s proclamation that the working class has no interests in protect¬ 
ing a nation owned by the rich would create strikes that would paralyze the 
industrial production necessary for the war. U.S. Authorities believed it would 
further reduce recruitment with its poignant lament over the “son sent off to war 
&#x2026; [who] will be yanked from the loving breast of the family to confront, gun in 
hand, another youth who is, like him, the light of his home, and whom he does 
not hate and cannot hate, because he does not even know him.” 118 Prosecuting 
attorneys argued that Flores Magon and Rivera intended to overthrow the U.S. 
government and to disrupt the war effort, thereby aiding the enemy’s cause. 
</p>

<p>
To corroborate this image of the defendants as a threat to national secu¬ 
rity, government attorneys introduced a speech pronounced by Flores Magon on 
May 27,1917 in defense of two comrades .These two men, Raul Palma and Odilon 
Luna, were being threatened with deportation for being anarchists who dared to 
speak out against the war. Therefore, both men—like so many others during this 
period—were being persecuted for violating two separate articles of anti-radical 
legislation. President Wilson’s 1917 Espionage Act had effectively forbidden any 
public statements opposing the First World War. President Roosevelt’s 1903 de¬ 
cree had stipulated the deportation of foreign anarchists. 
</p>

<p>
In his speech, Flores Magon boldly defended the right of all to speak free¬ 
ly. “It is precisely because the country is engaged in a war &#x2026; that we must talk, and 
must talk high and loud, hurt whom it may and no matter what the consequence 
of our words may be.” Indeed, Flores Magon used this discourse as a forum to 
declare his opposition to the war and to question the objectives and values that 
motivated it. After asserting that Carranza was merely the “lackey of Wilson and 
of the bandits of Wall Street,” Flores Magon explained how the working class was 
being slaughtered to serve the interests of the vampiric capitalist class: “We shall 
give our blood in the trenches so that our masters may debauch in banquets, the 
product of our sacrifice.” 119 Given this additional piece of inflammatory evidence, 
</p>


<p>

</p>




<p>
the prosecution argued that Flores Magon and Rivera would threaten the war ef¬ 
fort and that their anarchism would be a direct threat to the US government. 
</p>

<p>
The presiding judge, Benjamin F. Bledsoe, inveighed even more vigorously 
against the defendants. Bledsoe had already disclosed his reactionary tendencies 
by banning the Hollywood movie The Spirit of ’76, which explored the revolu¬ 
tionary conflict between the American colonies and their current ally, England. 
The judge openly ridiculed anarchism before the jury, praising the great Anglo- 
Saxon system of law as the proper ideal. 120 Echoing the current Patriot Act, Judge 
Bledsoe explained that national security took precedence over free speech. He af¬ 
firmed that dangerous times require extraordinary measures to safeguard the state 
and society. The jury only needed two hours to render its guilty verdict. Unlike 
the judge in his 1916 trial, Bledsoe felt no concern for Flores Magon’s frail health, 
sentencing him, a dangerous radical with a long criminal record, to 20 years in 
prison. Ricardo immediately realized that he would not survive prison to see the 
light of day ever again. Although the defense filed an appeal, it was denied by the 
court, which affirmed its disdain for the Mexicans’ calls for violent revolution. 
</p>

<p>
The U.S. government not only desired to silence the Mexican and Mexi- 
can-American radical voice, but also to dissuade the many women who had joined 
dissident groups. On June 13, 1918, just as the court was concluding its case 
against Flores Magon and Rivera, Judge Bledsoe ordered the arrest of Ricardo’s 
wife Maria. She had replaced Enrique Flores Magon after he had resigned from 
the editorial board of Regeneration. In this position, according to the Bledsoe, she 
had violated the same laws as her husband: she had placed copies of the indecent 
foreign-language newspaper in the mails without first filing a translation. Further¬ 
more, she had included one of her own statements along with the mailed copies 
of the 1918 Manifesto.This letter had asserted that the war was being waged in 
the interests of capitalists and tyrants, and was therefore meaningless to the work¬ 
ing class. Her statements had freely mocked the U.S. government, its flag, and its 
military. According to the judge, Maria had additionally violated the Trading With 
Enemies Act by sending copies of the 1918 Manifesto to Peru and Cuba. After 
her initial arraignment, Maria was released on bail. Luckily, the government never 
brought her to trial. Once the allied forces won the war and her husband was 
safely behind bars, the government no longer cared about prosecuting her. 
</p>

<p>
FLORES MAGtiN’S FINAL DAYS IN PRISON 
</p>

<p>
Ricardo Flores Magon and Librado Rivera were initially sent back to Mc¬ 
Neil Island, but Flores Magon was soon transferred to the drier climate of Leaven- 
</p>


<p>

</p>




<p>
worth Penitentiary because of his failing health. Rivera followed soon afterwards. 
Suffering profound emotional desolation and suffering from headaches, rheuma¬ 
tism, bronchitis, and encroaching blindness, Flores Magon turned to the only pur¬ 
suit that had ever brought him joy: expressing himself through writing.Through 
his voluminous correspondence, he remained engaged in historical, political, and 
literary developments. Flores Magon encouraged anarchists to join the syndicalist 
movement, which would be the nexus of production in the ideal world of the 
future. He discussed current events, condemning the Russian revolution for erect¬ 
ing a communist dictatorship. In many of his letters, he reflected on his life and 
his ideals. Although his ambitions had been frustrated many times, Flores Magon 
never regretted his oftentimes tragic role as a prophet of liberation. “My former 
comrades are practical men, while I am only a dreamer, and this, therefore, is my 
own fault.They have been the ant and I the cicada; while they have counted dol¬ 
lars, I have spent time counting the stars. I would like to make a man out of each 
human animal; they, more practical, have made an animal out of each man and 
have made themselves pastors of the flock. Nevertheless, I prefer to be a dreamer 
than a practical man.” 121 
</p>

<p>
Flores Magon continued to hope that true social and economic liberty 
would soon be achieved. “History is already writing the last lines of the period 
which had as its cradle the ruins of the Bastille, and is about to open a new pe¬ 
riod, whose first chapter will be known by generations to come as the groping of 
the human race upon the road to freedom.” 122 In one of his last letters, he again 
asserted his faith in a utopian future of worldwide freedom, brotherhood, equal¬ 
ity, and peace. “Not a prison, not a courthouse, not a capital building offend the 
sweet, tranquil beauty of the City of Peace. &#x2026; Its wondrous vernacular is full of 
words capable of expressing the subtlest and most elusive emotions, there is no 
meaning for the words Master and Slave, Charity and Piety, Authority and Obedi¬ 
ence.” 123 He described the life in this ideal world, “I watch the happy throngs 
of the City of Peace. &#x2026; These blessed people have found the way of making a 
pleasure out of work by suppressing the parasites and by becoming themselves 
the owners and the workers at the same time. Some of them are going to work, 
some of them are going merry making, but all of them bear the same radiant 
countenance, for work and play are now synonymous.” 124 
</p>

<p>
Just as Flores Magon expressed his passionate beliefs to his distant cor¬ 
respondents, he engaged other prisoners in profound historical, political, and lit¬ 
erary discussions. He helped educate other convicts and remained close to litera¬ 
ture by working quietly as the prison librarian. Flores Magon was widely revered 
</p>


<p>
BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH ★ 97 
</p>




<p>
by the many PLM and other Mexican convicts in Leavenworth. According to 
Gilbert O’Day, they would have done anything to ease the suffering of this slow¬ 
ly dying man, this man who had so bravely fought for their dignity through his 
words and actions. “There was not a Mexican worker in that prison—and there 
were many—who would not have laid down his life to give Magon a free and 
easy hour” 125 The many white U.S. radicals in Leavenworth also deeply respected 
this profoundly sincere anarchist.The great IWW organizer and songwriter Ralph 
Chaplin stated that Flores Magon impressed all as being “the highest type of revo¬ 
lutionary idealist,” 126 further describing him as “gentler and fiercer by nature than 
any man I had ever met.” 127 
</p>

<p>
Activists in both Mexico and the U.S. fought to secure the freedom of 
Flores Magon and Rivera. Anarchist, communist, and other leftist groups in Mexi¬ 
co demanded that their new president,Alvaro Obregon, pressure the U.S. to free 
the men. People tried to boycott U.S. goods so that its government would liberate 
Flores Magon and Rivera.Throughout Mexico, various labor unions called strikes 
to protest their imprisonment. On May Day, 1922, the anarcho-syndicalist Confed- 
eracion General deTrabajadores demonstrated loudly before the U.S. consulate in 
Mexico City against the persecution of Flores Magon and Rivera. 128 Workers in 
the state of Veracruz held an uncanny silent protest before the U.S. consul. 129 On 
November 8,1922, workers closed ports along the Atlantic coasts of Veracruz and 
the Yucatan. 
</p>

<p>
Although Obregon’s government gave lip service to the concerns of the 
Mexican left, he did not push the U.S. to liberate the convicts. His government was 
courting U.S. political and business support, so he feared alienating the norteam- 
ericanos. He was also unsure what the radicals Flores Magon and Rivera might do 
in the nation he now controlled. Unable to secure their liberty, one congressional 
deputy, Antonio Diaz Soto y Gama, Flores Magon and Rivera’s old Liberal Party 
cohort and a former spokesman for Emiliano Zapata, requested that the Mexican 
government offer them a pension. The prisoners, however, refused the money, 
stating that they could not in good conscience accept money stolen from the 
labor of Mexico’s working class. On the other hand, they gladly received contribu¬ 
tions from the many humble Mexican and North American workers who freely 
donated meager yet essential sums. 
</p>

<p>
As in Mexico, radicals in the U.S. Also struggled to liberate Ricardo Flores 
Magon and Librado Rivera. Members of the immigrant and U.S.-born Mexican com¬ 
munity were educated about the legacy of Ricardo Flores Magon and the PLM. 
White U.S. radicals also continued to publicize his unjust imprisonment.They sent 
</p>


<p>

</p>




<p>
letters to President Wilson asking that Flores Magon and all other political prison¬ 
ers be freed now that the war had been won. Others petitioned the government 
to release Flores Magon because of his poor health, or at least to make sure the 
prison took proper care of this very sick man. As Flores Magon realized, the in¬ 
human, bureaucratic prison machine regarded him as merely a number, #14596, 
locked away in a cell; and it would allow him to wither away. Even Senator Henry 
Cabot Lodge and the ACLU petitioned for Flores Magon and Rivera’s freedom, but 
to no avail. 
</p>

<p>
The radical lawyer Harry Weinberger, who had defended the great anar¬ 
chists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman on many occasions, also tried to 
aid the imprisoned men in numerous ways. He repeatedly pressured the prison to 
take better care of Flores Magon’s physical condition. Emphasizing Flores Magon’s 
fundamental idealism as well as his sickness, Weinberger wrote and even traveled 
to Washington, DC to solicit a pardon.The Attorney General informed him that a 
pardon would only be granted if Flores Magon and Rivera accepted the political 
institutions of the U.S. Naturally, the two convicts refused to accede to this de¬ 
mand, because it would require them to renounce the ideals they so passionately 
believed in. In any case, the U.S. government, like the Mexican, felt safer having 
Flores Magon remain behind bars. It feared that his voice would help rebuild the 
anarchist movement that it had just crushed.lt further worried that Flores Magon 
would radicalize immigrant and U.S.-born Mexicans, whose voices were already 
alarming authorities in the West and Southwest where they were protesting their 
exploitation. 
</p>

<p>
THE LAST GASPS OF A PROPHET 
</p>

<p>
Despite protests in Mexico and the U.S., Flores Magon continued to rot 
away in his jail cell, becoming progressively sicker and losing almost a third of his 
weight. At five o’clock in the morning on November 21,1922, Leavenworth Peni¬ 
tentiary pronounced the death of Ricardo Flores Magon. Prison doctors stated 
that the cause was cardiac arrest. However, the bruises around his neck and his 
contorted facial features seemed to indicate that he had died in a struggle. Among 
others, Flores Magon’s old comrade, Librado Rivera, believed a guard had stran¬ 
gled him to death. A fellow Leavenworth convict, the socialist leader Eugene V 
Debs, later remarked that, in any case, Ricardo was executed through slow torture 
by the U.S. government.The many Mexican prisoners in Leavenworth deeply re¬ 
sented the death of their hero. One PLM supporter, Jose Martinez, knifed the no-

<p>
toriously brutal guard, A. H. “John Bull” Leonard, who he believed had murdered 
Flores Magon. In turn, Martinez was killed by seven other guards . 130 
</p>

<p>
Thanks to the efforts of U.S. And Mexican activists, Ricardo Flores Magon’s 
body would not be condemned to the burial fields of Leavenworth, Kansas, nor 
would his dream be forgotten in Mexico. The wealthy radical Kate Crane Gartz 
and other sympathetic contributors funded the transportation of Flores Magon’s 
corpse from Leavenworth to Los Angeles for burial. Hundreds of Mexican, Mexi- 
can-American, and white workers and radicals met his body in Los Angeles. His 
wife Maria argued that this man who had fought for so long for Mexican liberation 
should be buried in the country of his birth. However, she refused the Mexican 
government s offer of assistance to bring back the body of this man who had 
struggled so long against all governments. Instead, the Mexican Federation of Rail¬ 
road Unions offered to deliver Flores Magon to Mexico City.The train bearing his 
coffin stopped at towns along the way. At each site, crowds formed to meet the 
casket and carry it through the streets. 
</p>

<p>
Since his death, Mexican governments have sought to co-opt the legacy 
of Ricardo Flores Magon. By the time his body arrived in Mexico, the revolution 
had ended and new leaders were safely in power.The new corrupt, authoritarian 
rulers tried to assume the mantle of the revolution to grant themselves legitimacy. 
Politicians used the death of Ricardo Flores Magon, a man who felt only disgust 
toward them while alive, to bolster their own careers. They may have been in¬ 
spired by the example of Ricardo’s old Liberal Party comrade,Antonio Diaz Soto y 
Gama. On hearing of Flores Magon's death, Diaz Soto y Gama delivered a powerful 
eulogy before the House of Deputies. Although he carefully worded this speech, 
he may, ironically, have contributed to a cult of personality, or personalismo, sur¬ 
rounding Flores Magon by framing him as the true precursor and intellectual 
author of the Mexican Revolution . 131 
</p>

<p>
Following Diaz Soto y Gama’s example, eager politicians greeted Flores 
Magon’s corpse in their towns with reverential odes. When he finally returned 
to Mexico City on January 16, 1923, the Mexican government gave him a mas¬ 
sive state funeral. Yet the workers and peasants also responded to the death of 
this man who had loved and fought for them. Supporters garbed in the anarchist 
colors, red and black, filled the streets singing revolutionary anthems such as the 
“Marseilles” and the “Internationale.” 
</p>

<p>
Years later, a new deeply corrupt, authoritarian, and oftentimes brutal po¬ 
litical party, the Partido Revolucionario Institucional, appropriated the mystique 
of the Mexican Revolution. Even though this political party lorded over the nation 
</p>

<p>
for over half a century, it tried to affiliate itself with a man who despised all gov¬ 
ernments. In 1945, the PRI transferred the body of Ricardo Flores Magon to the 
Rotunda of Illustrious Men, where it is currently enshrined. Ironically, this tomb 
is quite close to the place where Ricardo was first arrested during the student 
protests of 1892. 132 
</p>

<p>
Despite the Mexican government’s manipulations, Ricardo Flores Magon 
continues to inspire anarchists and other radicals throughout Mexico and the 
entire world. Shortly after his death, his longtime comrade and avid supporter, 
Nicolas T. Bernal, formed the Grupo Cultural “Ricardo Flores Magon” that began 
publishing his collected works. Mexican workers and prominent politicians, in¬ 
cluding Flores Magon’s old associate Antonio Villarreal, offered their assistance 
to this project. The Grupo Cultural issued the first biography of Flores Magon, 
Ricardo Flores Magon, el apostol de la revolucion mexicana in 1925.The au¬ 
thor of this work, Diego Abad de Santillan, later became a prominent member of 
the Confederacion Nacional delTrabajo/FederacionAnarquista Iberica during the 
Spanish Civil War and Revolution in the 1930s. 
</p>

<p>
And Ricardo Flores Magon’s influence lived on in Latin America. By 
1926, the Nicaraguan peasant Augusto “Cesar” Sandino had devoured the works 
of Flores Magon, inspiring him during the 1920s and 1930s to lead a libertarian 
revolt against the corrupt government of his country. 
</p>

<p>
In Mexico, leftists have always rallied to the revolutionary example of 
Ricardo Flores Magon. During the student and labor protests of 1968, one spokes¬ 
man praised the example of Ricardo Flores Magon in contrast to Mexican Presi¬ 
dent Gustavo Diaz Ordaz, a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party. The 
orator cried out the question: “&lt;jFue Flores Magon un vende patria?” (“Was Flores 
Magon a seller-out of his country?”) The quarter-of-a-million protesters proudly 
responded “No!” 132 In the 1980s, Chantal Lopez and Omar Cortes formed the 
publishing house Ediciones Antorcha &lt; www.antorcha.net &gt; that has published 
many works by and about Flores Magon, inspiring a new generation to embrace 
this revolutionary writer and activist. 
</p>

<p>
More recently, indigenous groups in Flores Magon’s home state of 
Oaxaca have formed the Consejo Indigena Popular de Oaxaca—Ricardo Flores 
Magon (CIPO-RFM), the Coordination Oaxaca Magonista Popular Antineoliberal 
(COMPA), and the Alianza Magonista Zapatista (AMZ) to fight for their political, 
social, economic, and environmental rights.These groups have been demonstrat¬ 
ing against the Mexican federal and the Oaxacan state governments’ attacks on 
their communities. However, their villages are still being attacked. It’s a familiar

<p>
story: massacres of campesinos by paramilitary goons funded by the large land- 
owners, with the massacres all but ignored by the PRI state government; death 
threats against and assassinations of indigenous activists by the same paramilitar¬ 
ies; brutal attacks on demonstrators by the police, and the arrests of the brutalized 
demonstrators on false charges 
</p>

<p>
Eighty years have passed since the death of Ricardo Flores Magon, yet 
Mexico’s government still treats political dissidents with the same disdain as it 
treated Magon: many members of the CIPO-RFM and COMPA are now withering 
away in jail cells because they dared to speak up for their human dignity. 133 We 
urge activists to support our downtrodden sisters and brothers in Oaxaca and to 
stay informed about their plight by reading the CIPO-RFM web site &lt; <a href="http://www">http://www</a>. 
nodo50.org/cipo &gt; and the AMZ web site &lt; <a href="http://espora.org/amz">http://espora.org/amz</a> &gt;.We further 
hope that our translations of the poetic words of the great anarchist prophet Ri¬ 
cardo Flores Magon will inspire the English-speaking world to continue his strug¬ 
gle for the liberation of humanity.

7 Farly biographers claim that Teodoro was a full-blooded Indian. For example, see Abau ue Santiiian, 
p. 25. However, Gonzalo Beltran objects, claiming Teodoro did not physically resemble a Oaxacan 
native: he was too tall and his sons did not possess Zapotec or Mixtec facial features. See his 
introduction to Antologta by Ricardo Flores Magon (Mexico: UNAM, 1970), p. vii. It is unclear who is 
correct: There are many different Indian tribes in Oaxaca with widely varying facial and body types. 
In addition, because peoples have migrated throughout history, it seems inappropriate to assume 
that any given individual would reflect the features of only one race.

61 See, in particular, Friedrich Nietzsches Genealogy of Morals (translated by Walter Kaufmann. New 
York: Viking Press, 1967.) Neither Flores Magon nor any of the secondary literature ever mentions 
him reading Nietzsche. However, Flores Magon was a voracious reader of world literature, so it 
would not be surprising if he had consumed Nietzsche’s works. In any case, Nietzschean ideas were 
definitely part of the intellectual culture of the early twentieth century, and prominent anarchists 
such as Emma Goldman wrote and delivered lectures about him.

71 Colin M. MacLachlan argues that Flores Magon may have found even more supporters if he had 
clearly proclaimed his anarchism, because many Mexicans had grown quite radical in reaction to 
Diaz.Thinking that Flores Magon was merely proposing reformist goals, many chose to turn to 
another revolutionary leader such as Francisco I. Madero. See Maclachlan, p.32.

LETTER TO MARIA 
</p>

<p>
OCTOBER 25, 1908 
</p>


<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
Maria: 
</p>

<p>
I anxiously await Saturdays so that I can see your little letters, my love. All 
week I’ve been waiting to see if you show up, from my cell through the window 
on the alley, which is the third window. Who did I see on Thursday between four 
and five but my little daughter Lucia [Norman], but she passed by without stop¬ 
ping. When you all pass by the third window on the alley, stop if only for a half 
minute so that I can see you well. My dear: I feel that you are feeling a bit of pain. 
Would some of my kisses where you hurt make it well? I would give them so 
tenderly that you’d feel no discomfort. I know, my life, I understand that you miss 
me as much as I miss you. But what can be done? More than the tyrants, it is our 
friends who are keeping us in jail, because their laziness, their indolence, their 
lack of initiative has them tied up, and they do nothing. I believe that they love 
us and have us in their hearts; but this isn’t enough to rescue us. What’s needed 
is that they work in an effective manner for our liberation, and they’re not doing 
that. Everyone comes forth in manifesting their sympathy for us and deploring 
our situation. We are devoting ourselves to putting an end to the tyrant in Mexico 
and nobody will lift an arm to stop the tyrant’s henchmen. There is much that 
could be done in our favor hut little or nothing is being done, and nothing, of 
course, is being gained.There should be a commission that is constantly after the 
press so that something could appear favorable to the prisoners, as much in the 
local press as that outside of California, taking advantage not only of the workers’ 
press but also that of the capitalist press. Another commission could take charge 
of agitating in every union in the United States in our favor; but all of this would 
have to be done constantly. Another commission could take charge of organiz¬ 
ing meetings in which the only topic would be the prisoners and the infamies 
which have been committed against us. If this would be done with persistence, 
we would walk free, and soon. If this would have been done a year ago, we would 
have been free for some time. I repeat, if nothing practical is done, the sympathy 
of our friends will do nothing for us.When will something practical be done? Per¬ 
haps never&#x2026;. Goodbye my love, look closely and you’ll see that it is our friends 
who are keeping us prisoner through their apathy. Receive my immense love and 
adoration, you, the only woman who makes my heart beat.What I’ve told you isn’t 
a reproach for you, my angel. You’re doing everything you can, and I thank you 
</p>

from my soul. If you don’t win in this struggle against despotism and do not res¬ 
cue your Ricardo who loves and adores you, it won’t have been for lack of effort 
on your part. With all my soul, your Ricardo kisses you tenderly.

<p>
LETTER FROM L.A. COUNTY JAIL 
</p>

<p>
June 13,1908 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
I’m writing this letter to you on June 13, 1908, dear brothers Praxedis 
and Enrique, to bring to your attention a matter of which I’ve already informed 
our comrade Librado [Rivera],and he’s in agreement. Let’s get to the point. 
</p>

<p>
You know as well as I do that no revolution has ever managed to prevail 
after the triumph and make practical the ideals which inflamed the revolution, 
and this has happened because it was entrusted to the new government to do 
what the people should have done during the revolution. 
</p>

<p>
It has always happened the same way. In all parts a banner has been raised 
bearing reforms of more or less importance; the humble unite around it; there is 
fighting; blood flows more or less abundantly, and if the revolution triumphs, a 
new congress meets entrusted with transforming into law the ideals that caused 
the people to take up arms and fight. To the congress come individuals with all 
types of ideals, some advanced, others retrograde, still others moderate, and in 
the struggle between these tendencies the aspirations of the revolution wither, 
become spoiled, and after long months, when not after long years, laws are ap¬ 
proved in which one cannot even glimpse the ideals for which the people gave 
their blood and for which they suffered misfortune. But suppose that by some 
miracle laws were promulgated in which the ideals of the revolution shone in 
all their purity, something which has never been seen, certainly, because very 
few deputies have the same ideals as the people who took up arms. But let’s sup¬ 
pose that the miracle became reality and in the special case of our struggle the 
congress ordered the distribution of the lands, the eight-hour day, and a wage of 
no less than a peso. Could we hope that the landholders would cross their arms 
and let escape that which makes them powerful and permits them to live in idle¬ 
ness? The owners of all types of enterprises where workers arms are employed, 
wouldn’t they close their businesses or, at the least, wouldn’t they diminish the 
</p>


<p>
CHAPTER ONE: LETTERS ★ 111 
</p>




<p>
number of workers they employ in order to force the government to revoke the 
law under the threat of the hunger of the people, feigning that it’s materially im¬ 
possible to pay more for fewer hours of work? 
</p>

<p>
With their resources exhausted by the revolution, the people would find 
themselves in a condition more difficult than that under which they found them¬ 
selves obliged to revolt. The people, without bread, would listen to the words of 
the bourgeoisie, who would tell them that they had been fooled, and who would 
lead the charge to overthrow the new government, with which some of them 
would save themselves from the loss of their lands and others from making con¬ 
cessions to the workers. 
</p>

<p>
The rich would rebel if there would be an attempt to put into practice 
the Program of the Partido Liberal Mexicano, if, by a true and unique miracle in 
the history of popular revolutions, the ideals of the revolution would remain in¬ 
tact after the triumph. 
</p>

<p>
As anarchists we know well all of this. We know well what must be ex¬ 
pected from even the best government that weighs down on the people, and, as 
anarchists, we should do everything that is within our reach to make sure that the 
revolution that is waiting in the wings to break out gives to the people all of the 
benefits which it is possible to win. 
</p>

<p>
To obtain great benefits for the people, real benefits, it’s necessary to 
work as well-disguised anarchists, even from those who take us as their leaders. 
Everything boils down to a mere question of tactics. If from the start we would 
have called ourselves anarchists, no one, not even a few, would have listened. 
Without calling ourselves anarchists we’ve been placing in men’s minds thoughts 
of hate against the possessing class and against the governmental caste. No other 
liberal party in die world has the anti-capitalist tendencies from which a revolu¬ 
tion is about to break out in Mexico, and this has been achieved without our 
saying we are anarchists; and it wouldn’t have been accomplished even if we had 
simply called ourselves socialists, let alone anarchists as we are. Everything, then, 
is a question of tactics. 
</p>

<p>
We must give the lands to the people in the course of the revolution, 
because in this manner they won’t be swindled.There’s not a single government 
anywhere that can benefit the people contrary to the interests of the bourgeoisie. 
You know this well as anarchists, and therefore I don’t need to demonstrate it to 
you through reasoning and examples. We must also give the people possession of 
the factories, mines, etc. In order that the entire nation doesn’t turn its back on us, 
we should continue the same tactic that we’ve used with so much success: we’ll 
</p>


<p>
112 ★ DREAMS OF FREEDOM 
</p>




<p>
continue calling ourselves liberals in the course of the revolution, but in reality 
we’ll go on propagating anarchy and carrying out anarchist acts. We’ll continue 
expropriating from the bourgeoisie and making restitution to the people with 
what we seize. I have here the means that has occurred to me, and I submit it to 
your attention: in virtue of the revolution, the factories, mines, workshops, etc. Are 
going to close their doors, not because the workers have taken up arms, because 
not all will take them up, but for other reasons among which could be the paraly¬ 
sis or diminishment of commercial transactions owing to the insecurity affecting 
commercial interests in times in which respect for authority has diminished, and 
the order in all places dominated by the revolution will be such that the workers 
will not be paid less than one peso per the newly established eight-hour day.The 
consequence of this process, due to the bourgeoisie, will be hunger, because with 
their stocks exhausted they won’t take a step to produce more. 
</p>

<p>
We shouldn’t wait for hunger to arrive; therefore as soon as work stops 
on a hacienda, a factory closes its doors, a mine ceases to extract metal, etc., 
we’ll invoke the public necessity that work not stop, whatever the pretext of the 
bosses for suspending it, and with the reason that it’s necessary to renew work, 
to impede pauperism, we’ll give to the workers the businesses that have been 
closed by the bourgeoisie, so that they can continue to produce on the footing of 
equality. 
</p>

<p>
To avoid that the workers who benefit will not try to turn themselves in 
turn into the bourgeoisie, we’ll prescribe that everyone who enters to work in 
these businesses will have an equal right to participate. The workers themselves 
will administer these businesses. 
</p>

<p>
If we’re dealing with haciendas, it would be unjust to give all of the land 
to the workers of the same because then many would remain without anything. 
The workers on the haciendas would be given what they could actually work, 
with the rest of the lands reserved so that they could be used by the rest of the 
poor. As the workers on the haciendas would continue to work under this plan, 
those who wanted lands that are presently lying idle, upon seeing the excellent 
results of working the land in common practiced by the redeemed peons would, 
in place of working the lands individually, want also to work them in common, 
and thus there would be no necessity to divide up the earth into parcels, saving 
the junta from the odious task of giving to each one who asks it a piece of land. 
</p>

<p>
Even though the businesses would remain in the hands of the workers, 
their transfer or sale would be prohibited just as the PLM program prescribes for 
the lands. In this manner, work would begin again in the midst of the revolution 
</p>


<p>
CHAPTER ONE: LETTERS ★ 113 
</p>




<p>
and an anarchist work would have been accomplished through invoking the ne¬ 
cessity that production could not cease to avoid the hunger of the masses. 
</p>

<p>
It’s necessary to take into account that with the workers being unable to 
count on money being paid them as a daily wage with which to buy the neces¬ 
sities of life, it’s essential that they themselves establish a statistics commission 
which would have a registry of the available resources in each region dominated 
by the revolution, just as it would register the needs of the laboring masses in each 
region. Having this register, the workers would mutually exchange their products 
and would have such an excess of production that they could easily, without sac¬ 
rifice, support the soldiers of the revolution. In addition, the workers would be 
counseled to arm themselves to defend what the revolution has given them from 
the assaults of the soldiers fighting for tyrants, and probably from attacks by the 
gringos or from other nations. 
</p>

<p>
At first we shouldn’t bother ourselves about the foreign bourgeoisie, not 
until almost the entire people have something material to defend and for which 
to respect themselves.When the outcasts have something to defend, we ll see that 
there won’t be one who won’t pick up a gun. 
</p>

<p>
New problems will present themselves, but I don’t believe that they will 
be difficult to solve, given that the workers themselves will be interested in the 
matter.There will come, also, many Spanish and Italian anarchists to see what is 
occurring, and they will provide useful aid. It appears to me that it would be good 
if one of us would take a trip during the revolution to spur those comrades to give 
us the valuable aid of coming to agitate the masses and directing them in every 
matter where direction is needed. I believe that a great many would come, even 
paying their own way, afterwards leaving a scattering of comrades throughout the 
entire nation. 
</p>

<p>
Working in the manner I propose, if we don’t succeed we’ll at least have 
left the legacy of a great lesson. 
</p>

<p>
I’m already tired. I’m writing in such an awkward position that my chest 
hurts, and, incidentally, I’m already very ill. I don’t stop coughing, my back hurts 
and I feel bad, very bad.That which sustains me is that I’m not discouraged.The 
cold which is continually in this jail is aggravating my ill health. I weighed 218 
pounds, and today I weigh only 178 .The jail is made of iron; I never see a ray of 
sunshine; the cold wind blows day and night, and as sensitive as my lungs have 
always been, I feel that I can’t stand another winter in this jail in which there is 
no heating for the prisoners. I have a very bad cold that hasn’t left me since they 
threw me in jail. I’m better for two or three days at a time, but then it attacks me 
</p>


<p>
114 ★ DREAMS OF FREEDOM 
</p>




<p>
again with more force. At this moment I’m running a fever.The good thing is that 
I’m not discouraged and so I give myself strength. But back to the matter which 
motivates this letter. 
</p>

<p>
I believe that it is necessary that many anarchists come to teach the 
people. Besides, it’s good to reprint anarchist books and pamphlets to be distrib¬ 
uted by the millions. We can entrust this to our friends and comrades with confi¬ 
dence. 
</p>

<p>
I continue speaking of the same thing todayjune 15, dear brothers. 
</p>

<p>
There will be very crafty members of the bourgeoisie who, seeing what’s 
happening to their comrades, will not close their businesses and then there will 
be no immediate pretext for taking their property. In these cases, which will be 
more and more frequent, the workers of these businesses will be incited to ask 
for “impossible” things in such a manner that the owners will be forced to close. 
Then the workers will take possession of the businesses. 
</p>

<p>
I know that there are two ways to go, both of which would follow the 
path of expropriation: the junta could decree it, or, better, the workers could 
carry it out themselves; and in this case, which to me appears the better of the 
two, because it would disguise very well the anarchist character of the junta, we 
wouldn’t have to approve faits accompli.The question is of bringing, once the 
revolution has commenced and is on foot, a great number of comrades from Eu¬ 
rope to foster in Mexico the publication of many anarchist periodicals. As we’ll 
have money, all of this can be done easily. Only the anarchists are going to know 
that we are anarchists, and we’ll advise them not to call us anarchists in order not 
to frighten some imbecile who in the bottom of his heart harbors ideals like our 
own, but without knowing that they are anarchist ideals, because he is so accus¬ 
tomed to hearing anarchists talked about in disparaging terms. It’s better that the 
imbeciles remain ignorant.They’re not necessarily unjust. 
</p>

<p>
That which is done by the workers themselves will have to be firmer, 
because it will be the result of conscious effort. So, then, I believe that this will be 
the best tactic: to agitate the workers, urging them to expropriate.The junta, prior 
to the carrying out of these acts, will have to approve them. In this manner we’ll 
continue to give the catch phrase of “liberalism” to our beautiful ideals. 
</p>

<p>
It appears to me that there’s nothing to add to this&#x2026;. 
</p>

<p>
I also think regarding the publication of Revolution that the name after 
all is of little importance, but due to a natural romanticism it would please me if 
the name of the periodical would be Regeneration . 
</p>


<p>
CHAPTER ONE: LETTERS ★ 115 
</p>




<p>
I now believe that the Old Man [Porfirio Diaz] will not be able to suffo¬ 
cate the revolution and that in the end the people will have justice. 
</p>

<p>
I hope that the blood which will be shed will be fertile in producing 
benefits for the proletariat, and I believe that it will be if we put ourselves to 
something better than allying with the bourgeoisie to obtain an easy triumph; 
well obtain real liberties for the people, emancipating it economically, step by 
step or leap by leap, as can happen in the course of the great revolution in whose 
shadows we find ourselves. 
</p>

<p>
I dream of great, real conquests during the revolution. We must not hesi¬ 
tate. It s very possible that our revolution will break the European stalemate and 
that those proletarians will decide to do what we’ve done. Perhaps if we bring to 
a head what I propose, the great powers of Europe will pile on us, but this will be 
the final act of the governmental farce, because I’m sure that our brothers on the 
other side of the ocean will not let us perish. 
</p>

<p>
If we manage to have success during the revolution, that is, if we manage 
to expropriate and redistribute, it doesn’t matter how many years our movement 
lasts. 
</p>

<p>
We should strive that the great majority of leaders and revolutionary of¬ 
ficials are more or less men of our way of thinking and, to that effect, [Teodoro 
Maria] Gaitan,like [Fernando] Palomarez,like others, [Norberto] Loya for example, 
could be the strength of our side, because there are many, very many, who think 
only of personal aggrandizement. Having control, the libertarians will achieve 
great things. 
</p>

<p>
For leaders of the zones in which there are not now groups, we should 
name libertarians. 
</p>

<p>
A phenomenal amount of libertarian propaganda is necessary.We should 
undertake to ensure that anarchist periodicals send flyers to be reprinted in Mex¬ 
ico with money yanked from the hands of the bourgeoisie. All this work can be 
undertaken by trusted friends so that the junta can continue maintaining its ap¬ 
parently “free” role. 
</p>

<p>
Following the tactic that I propose to you in the attached letter, we will 
never have a better opportunity to work for the ideal than in the midst of the 
revolution. 
</p>

<p>
I’ll say goodbye. 
</p>

<p>
I send a strong embrace to all, and to you, little brother, my great fraternal 
affection. Librado also sends you his greetings. Greetings to all.

Regeneracion, August 7, 1900 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
N()TH:This is a fragment of a longer proclamation which is almost unreadable. 
It iras not written by Ricardo Flores Magon and is of purely historical inter¬ 
est (as the founding statement of Regen eradon&gt;, so we’re reproducing only a 
small fragment of it here. Us first paragraphs, reproduced here, provide a good 
indication of its flavor. 
</p>

<p>
This periodical is the product of a painful conviction. 
</p>

<p>
In the speech pronounced in the solemn session of March 9, upon re¬ 
suming the sessions of the Academia Central Mexicana de Jurisprudence y Legis¬ 
lation, the attorney, Mr. Luis Mendez, wisely said:“When justice becomes corrupt¬ 
ed, when at times decisions are reached more because of external considerations 
than the law itself, what should those do who exercise the noble profession of 
advocate or those who watch over interests that have no guarantees for their 
lives and development than an honest administration of justice? Shouldn’t we all, 
in such a case, form ourselves into firm group, such as a Greek phalanx, to attack 
obstinate injustices?” 
</p>

<p>
This is what is encountered, with very honorable exceptions, in the ad¬ 
ministration of justice in the republic; and the Greek phalanx spoken of by the 
honorable attorney could come crashing down, as have many others protesting 
against the venalitv of some functionaries, receiving only unjust persecutions or 
the obstinate injustice spoken of by Mr. Mendez. 
</p>

<p>
We do not have the pretension of being a phalanx; but our youthful en¬ 
ergy and our patriotism induce us to search for a remedy, and to that end, to point 
out, to denounce all those acts of judicial functionaries not in accord with the 
precepts of written law in order to publicly shame them into delivering deserved 
justice&#x2026;.

<p>
INDEPENDENT PERIODICAL OF COMBAT 
</p>

<p>
Regeneration, December 31, 1900 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
Today, Regeneration appears as the “Independent Periodical of Com¬ 
bat.” 
</p>

<p>
As we could be dismissed as inconsequential, well explain to our illustri¬ 
ous readers the cause which has impelled us to change the overall juridic nature 
of this periodical. 
</p>

<p>
Justice, badly administered as it has been to date, was the primary thing 
that induced us to found our periodical, destined to exhibit in all its deformity the 
arbitrariness and abuses of the abominable functionaries of the judicial branch, 
local, state, and federal. 
</p>

<p>
Justice has been, here [Mexico City] and in the states, a slave to execu¬ 
tives without conscience who have found in it nothing but an easy and truly 
comfortable means of satisfying their passion, that in a more ordinary setting 
would have encountered the rude opposition of the correctional judge or the 
fierce hand of the police. 
</p>

<p>
The judiciary (there are exceptions, though they are, unfortunately, 
scarce), filled with nonentities from the “cientifieo” and many times from the 
“moral” orders, are resented and continue to be resented for their failure to ex¬ 
pedite, and what is worse, in some cases, that elsewhere abound, for lack of hon¬ 
esty. 
</p>

<p>
Our struggle has been hard. It has had all the characteristics of a fight be¬ 
tween dwarves and giants; alone in the struggle, finding ourselves facing at every 
step the livid phantasm of political indifference, we have struggled while isolated, 
with no other arm than our democratic ideals, and with no shield other than our 
profound convictions. 
</p>

<p>
What might have pained us the most in our enthusiasm has been that 
hateful form of political cowardice: indifference, a product of the age, the age of 
oppression which has made the weak spirits opt for the party of force, because 
that’s what they themselves lack and it’s what will protect their cowardice, and 
that those other spirits, not exactly weak, but not really apt for an open, frank 
struggle, prefer to find in a retreat from public life a sedative for their political 
disappointments. 
</p>


<p>
CHAPTER TWO: DOCUMENTS ★ 121 
</p>




<p>
We don’t shrink back before political indifference precisely because 
healthy ideals help us to recover, because firm convictions comfort us and we 
believe that we possess strong energies. 
</p>

<p>
The day that we lack any of these things we’ll have died of that which is 
called “good citizenship,” and we’ll hide our ignominy in the hybrid camp of indif¬ 
ference; but while there still blows in us the wind of liberal ideas, while the demo¬ 
cratic spirit of our reformers influences us with its healthy, virile life, and while 
the sacred republican principles inflame our young souls, which are desirous of 
the public good, we’ll struggle without respite, until we attain our ideals, thinking 
always that these ideals are those of our fathers of 1857, sustained vigorously on 
the platform, in the book, in the press, and on the battlefields. 
</p>

<p>
Our struggle for justice hasn’t been more than a reflection of our prin¬ 
ciples; but this struggle has been circumscribed to a small radius of action; we 
couldn’t deal with anything more than judicial affairs. Inasmuch as our conscious¬ 
ness takes in the wide view of general administration, the motto of our periodical, 
“juridical,” impeded us from embarking upon other areas of interest more delicate 
and transcendent, if you will, than the judicial. 
</p>

<p>
But our principles have won out, have pushed beyond the juridical camp, 
and have entered fully into the camp of general administration. 
</p>

<p>
It has to be so.The administration of justice is no more than a comple¬ 
ment, as a power, to the other two: the executive and the legislative. Even though 
they have distinct attributes, the three powers must exist conjointly. In the man¬ 
ner that, if one of them takes a wrong path and has immense and deplorable omis¬ 
sions, the others will have them equally, because they’re part of the same general 
administration. 
</p>

<p>
These reasons have induced us to change the motto oi Regen eraciu n. 
</p>

<p>
At the same time, we ll continue to deal with juridical affairs as we’ve 
done so far, and we’ll continue making critiques, perhaps a little more bitter, but 
no less just, of the actions of the judicial functionaries. 
</p>

<p>
Let us hope that our efforts are agreeable to the public, which is our 
judge and whose decision we respectfully await.

<p>
BASES FOR THE UNIFICATION OF THE PLM 
</p>

<p>
1905 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
LThe Organizing Junta of the Partido Liberal Mexicano is constituted of the per¬ 
sons who sign the following manifesto.The Junta will exist publicly, and it will 
reside in exile for reasons of safety, until it is safe to return, due to the attacks 
of the Mexican government.The Junta will work to organize the Partido Liberal 
Mexicano and with the aid provided by its coreligionists will struggle with all 
available means against the dictatorship of Porfirio Piaz. Regeneracion will be the 
official organ of the Junta. 
</p>

<p>
II. Mexican citizens who are in accord with the ideas of the manifesto and who 
desire the liberty of the country will form in the areas where they reside secret 
groups that will be in communication with the Junta. We advise our coreligion¬ 
ists in these groups to avoid useless formalities. All that we ask is that the liberal 
citizens of every area meet from time to time to consider the nation’s political 
affairs and to maintain contact with the Junta, be it to communicate news of po¬ 
litical affairs to it, be it to propose projects to it, or simply to maintain established 
relations. We urge our coreligionists to form groups with as many members as 
possible; but if in some areas there is only a single citizen who holds our ideas, he 
shouldn’t hesitate to contact us because of his isolation. 
</p>

<p>
III. Those groups or citizens who support the present call should let the Junta 
know of this, and should record their names with the members of the Party who 
have reorganized. These groups and citizens will send monthly to the Junta, ac¬ 
cording to their resources and their individual desires, a contribution which will 
be invested in the costs required for the fulfillment of the goals of the following 
manifesto. 
</p>

<p>
IV The Junta, aside from its own work, will attempt to promote the publication of 
oppositionist periodicals in Mexico, will distribute funds among the liberal mili¬ 
tants who find themselves in poverty, and will sustain those whom the dictator¬ 
ship has jailed and robbed; if there are cases in which a public functionary loses 
his position for having complied with his duties, we’ll aid him also.We yearn that 
</p>


<p>
CHAPTER TWO: DOCUMENTS ★ 123 
</p>




<p>
there be effective solidarity among the liberals, and for that to happen we count 
on the effective aid of our coreligionists. 
</p>

<p>
V. The Junta will guard in absolute secrecy the names of the initiated. Do not 
communicate among yourselves, groups or affiliated individuals, until you are con¬ 
vinced that the group or person in question is truly dedicated to our cause. But if 
some member of the Party does not want to be contacted by the rest, let us know 
and well respect his decision. 
</p>

<p>
Through these means well organize ourselves without danger, and when our Par¬ 
ty has the strength it will unfurl its banners and undertake the decisive struggle 
against the odious tyranny. 
</p>

<p>
Mexicans: 
</p>

<p>
Immense are our misfortunes, tremendous our miseries, and many and 
terrible the outrages which have humiliated us during three long decades of des¬ 
potism. But you are patriots, you are honorable and noble, and you will not permit 
that crime will eternally prevail.The Partido Liberal calls for a holy struggle for the 
redemption of the nation. Respond to the call, unite with our forces and efforts 
beneath the standards of justice and right, so that the country will surge grandly 
forward, forever redeemed and free.

<p>
MANIFESTO TO THE NATION 
</p>

<p>
THE PLAN OF THE PARTIDO LIBERAL MEXICANO 
</p>

<p>
July 1, 1906 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
Translator’s Note: Extremely long single-sentence paragraphs were fairly com¬ 
mon in Spanish-language writing of the period in which this was written, 
and this manifesto provides a good example of this practice. For example, the 
paragraph beginning with Public offices .. ’’is a 700-plus-word single-sentence 
paragraph in the original Spanish, and I’ve left it as such here, just as I have 
left many other very long sentences intact. The primary reason for this is that 
</p>


<p>
124 ★ DREAMS OF FREEDOM 
</p>




<p>
to alter the structure to put it in line with modern usage would change the 
“flavor” of this manifesto to an unreasonable degree. 
</p>

<p>
Mexicans: 
</p>

<p>
I have here the program, the banner of the Partido Liberal, under which 
all of you should unite who have not renounced being free men, all of you who 
are smothering in this ignominious atmosphere which has enveloped you for 
thirty years, all of you who are ashamed of the enslavement of the country (which 
is your own slavery), all of you who hold against your tyrants the rebellion— 
blessed rebellion—of those restless under the yoke, because that feeling of re¬ 
bellion is the signal that dignity and patriotism have not died in the heart that 
shelters them. 
</p>

<p>
Think, Mexicans, of what it would mean for the country if the program 
of the Partido Liberal Mexicano, today raised like a shining banner, were put into 
effect—a program calling you to a holy struggle for liberty and justice, to guide 
your steps along the way of redemption, to show you the luminous goal that you 
can reach only if you decide to unite your forces in order to stop being slaves.The 
program, of course, is not perfect—no human work is—but it is benevolent, and 
under the present circumstances in our country it is our salvation. It is the incar¬ 
nation of many noble aspirations, the remedy for many evils, the correction for 
many injustices, the end of many infamies. It’s a radical transformation: the end of 
a world of oppression, of corruption, of crimes that will give way to a freer, more 
honorable, more just world. 
</p>

<p>
Everything will change in the future. 
</p>

<p>
Public offices won’t be for sycophants and schemers, but for those who, 
by their merits, make themselves worthy of the public trust; public functionaries 
won’t be these depraved, vicious sultans who are today protected by the dictator¬ 
ship and authorized to dispose of the homes, lives, and honor of the citizens; on 
the contrary, they will be men elected by the public to watch over the public’s 
interests, and who, if they don’t do so, will have to answer before the same people 
who had favored them; this disgusting venality that today characterizes the tri¬ 
bunals of justice will disappear, because there will be no dictatorship bestowing 
judicial robes upon its lackeys, but rather the people will designate with their 
votes those who administer justice, and because the responsibility of functionar¬ 
ies will not be a myth in the democratic future; the Mexican worker will stop 
being what he is today—an outcast in his own land; instead he’ll be master of 
his own rights, dignified, free to defend himself from this vile exploitation which 
</p>


<p>
CHAPTER TWO: DOCUMENTS ★ 125 
</p>




<p>
today is imposed upon him by force; he will not have to work more than eight 
hours per day; he will not receive less than one peso per day; he will have time to 
rest, to have a good time, to educate himself, and to enjoy various comforts which 
he could never afford with his present salary of 50 , or even 25 , centavos per day; 
there won’t be a dictatorship to counsel the capitalists who rob the worker and 
to protect the foreign forces who answer with a rain of bullets the peaceful peti¬ 
tions of Mexican workers; in contrast we’ll have a government that, elected by the 
people will serve the people and which will watch over its compatriots, without 
attack from foreign interests, but also without permitting the excesses and abuses 
so common at present; the vast holdings that the big landowners hold empty and 
uncultivated will cease being silent and desolate testimony to the sterile power 
of a man and, collected by the state, will be distributed among those who want 
to work them; they will be converted into fertile and happy fields which give sus¬ 
tenance to many noble families; there will be lands for all who want to cultivate 
them, and the wealth they produce will not be for the enjoyment of a boss who 
puts in not the least effort in producing it, but it will be for the active worker 
who after opening a furrow and throwing in the seed with a hand trembling with 
hope, will bring in the harvest that is his through his sweat and effort; with the 
throwing from power of the insatiable vampires who today exploit him, and who 
because of their greed crush him with debts and government loans; taxes will 
be reduced considerably; now, the fortunes of the government take their leave 
of the public treasury—when this doesn’t happen, there will be a giant savings, 
and the taxes will have to come down, lowering absolutely, of cuui sc, personal 
taxes and taxes upon moral capital, which today are truly intolerable; there will 
be no obligatory military service, this pretext under which the current honchos 
yank men irom tneii noiiies because they uislikc iiicir pridclui attitudes or be¬ 
cause they’re obstacles to the desires of the corrupt little tyrants to their abusing 
helpless women; education will be widespread, which is the basis of the better¬ 
ment of all peoples; the clergy, this unrepentant traitor, this subject of Rome, this 
irreconcilable enemy of native liberties, in place of finding tyrants to serve and 
from whom to receive protection, will find instead inflexible laws which will put 
a limit on their excesses and which will confine them to the religious sphere; the 
expression of ideas will find no unjustifiable restrictions which impede the free 
judgment of civic men; the inviolability of private life will disappear, which so 
often has been a shield for corruption and evil, and public peace will stop being a 
pretext under which governments persecute their enemies; all liberties will be re¬ 
stored to the people and not only will the citizens have won their political rights, 
</p>


<p>
126 ★ DREAMS OF FREEDOM 
</p>




<p>
but also a great economic improvement; not only will there be a triumph over 
tyranny, but also a triumph over misery. Liberty, prosperity: here is the synthesis 
of the program. 
</p>

<p>
Think, fellow citizens, of what it would mean to the country if these 
redemptory ideas were realized; look at our presently oppressed nation—op¬ 
pressed, miserable, held in contempt, a prisoner of foreigners whose insolence 
grows larger with the cowardice of our tyrants; look at how the despots have 
trampled on the national dignity, inviting foreign forces to invade our territory; 
imagine to what disasters and to what ignominy these traitors whom we tolerate 
in power, who counsel that the Mexican worker be robbed and mistreated, who 
have claimed to recognize the debt contracted by the pirate Maximilian to sup¬ 
port his usurpation, who have continually given proofs of the contempt they hold 
for the nationality of which we compatriots of Juarez and Lerdo de Tejada are 
proud; imagine to what disasters and what ignominy these traitors can conduct 
us. Contemplate, Mexicans, that abyss the dictatorship is opening under your feet, 
and compare this black chasm with the shining summit shown to you by the 
Partido Liberal so that you’ll dispose yourselves to climb it. 
</p>

<p>
Here, slavery, misery, shame; there, liberty, well-being, honor; here, the 
country in chains, exhausted by so much exploitation, subjected to whatever the 
foreign powers want to do to it, its dignity trampled upon by its own and by for¬ 
eigners; there, the country free of yokes, it will prosper, with the prosperity of all 
its children, great and respected because of the lofty independence of its people; 
here, despotism with all its horrors; there, freedom in all its glory. Choose! 
</p>

<p>
It is impossible to present to you in simple, benumbing words the pic¬ 
ture of the sovereign, luminous nation of tomorrow—redeemed, dignified, full of 
majesty and grandeur. But don’t let this stop you from appreciating this magnifi¬ 
cent picture, since you yourselves will bring it forth with your enthusiasm if you 
are patriots, if you love this soil which your fathers sanctified, irrigating it with 
their blood, if you haven’t denied your race which has known crushing despo¬ 
tisms and monarchs, if you haven’t resigned yourselves to death as slaves beneath 
the triumphal chariot of dominating caesarism. It’s useless for us to attempt to 
lift from your eyes the veil of the future, to show you that which will come into 
being through you yourselves: you will see what we could show to you. Console 
yourselves for the sorrow of our current servitude by evoking the picture of the 
free country of the future; you, the good Mexicans, you who hate the yoke, will 
illuminate the blackness of current oppression with the radiant vision of tomor-

<p>

<p>
row and the expectation that from one moment to the next your visions of liberty 
will become real. 
</p>

<p>
From you springs the hope of the country’s redemption, from you, the 
good sons, the ones immune to the cowardice and corruption that the tyrants 
sow, from you, the loyal, the unbreakable, those who feel yourselves full of faith 
in the triumph of justice; respond to the call of the country: the Partido Liberal 
has reserved a place for you beneath its banners, which are raised in defiance of 
despotism; all of us who fight for liberty have a place open in our ranks; come to 
our side, contribute to strengthening our party, and so push for the realization of 
that which we all desire. Let us unite; let us add together our efforts; let us unify 
our purposes and the program will become a fact. 
</p>

<p>
Utopia! A dream! shout those who, hiding their terror through abject 
rationalizations, intend to stop the popular reclamations so as not to lose a lucra¬ 
tive post or a less-than-clean business. It’s the old refrain of all of those who resist 
the great advances of the peoples; it’s the eternal defense of infamy. They call 
“utopian” what is redemptory in order that it be attacked or destroyed; all those 
who have attacked our wise constitution have wanted to excuse themselves by 
saying that it’s unrealizable; today the lackeys of Porfirio Diaz repeat this thing 
necessary to hiding the crimes of the tyrant, and these miserable persons do not 
remember that this constitution, which they call so utopian, so inadequate for our 
people, so impossible to put into practice, was perfectly realizable under noble 
rulers like Juarez and Lerdo de Tejada. For evildoers, good must be unrealizable; 
for the cunning, honor must be unrealizable.Tlic mouthpieces of despotism judge 
that the program of the Partido Liberal is impractical and even absurd; but you, 
Mexicans who aren’t blinded by convenience nor by fear; you, noble men who 
desire the good of the country, will tome to the simple realization of how much 
rudimentary justice this program contains. 
</p>

<p>
Mexicans: 
</p>

<p>
Upon the proclamation of its program by the Partido Liberal, with the 
inflexible purpose of putting it into practice, you are invited to take part in this 
great and redemptory work which must be done in order to have forever a free, 
respectable, happy country. 
</p>

<p>
The decision is irrevocable. The Partido Liberal will fight without rest 
to fulfill the solemn promise that it makes today to the people, and there will be 
no obstacle that it will not overcome, nor any sacrifice that it will not accept to 
achieve its end.Today we call you to follow its banners, to fill its ranks, to augment 
</p>


<p>
1 28 ★ DREAMS OF FREEDOM 
</p>




<p>
its strength, and to make less difficult and less painful the victory. If you listen to 
the call and come to the post that befits your duty as Mexicans, you’ll have a lot 
to thank the party for, since you’ll be working for your own redemption; if you 
see with indifference the holy struggle to which we invite you, if you refuse to aid 
those who fight for right and justice, if through egotism or timidness you make 
yourselves accomplices of those who oppress us, the country owes you nothing 
other than contempt, and your rebellious conscience will never stop shaming 
you with the memory of your failure.Those who refuse to support the cause of 
liberty deserve to be slaves. 
</p>

<p>
Mexicans: 
</p>

<p>
Between that which despotism offers you and that which the program 
of the Partido Liberal offers you, choose! If you want shackles, misery, humiliation 
before foreigners, the grey life of the debased outcast, support the dictatorship 
which gives you all of this; if you prefer liberty, economic improvement, the rais¬ 
ing up of the Mexican citizenry, the noble life of the man who is master of himself, 
come to the Partido Liberal that fraternizes with the noble and the virile, and join 
your efforts with those of all of us who fight for justice, to hurry the arrival of 
the radiant day on which tyranny will fall forever and the awaited democracy will 
surge forth with all the splendor of a star which never ceases shining brilliantly 
on the clear horizon of our country.

ToThe Nation: 
</p>

<p>
Fellow citizens, in legitimate defense of trod-upon liberties, of infringed 
rights, of the dignity of the country trampled upon by the criminal despotism of 
the usurper, Porfirio Diaz; in defense of our honor and our lives threatened by a 
government that considers integrity a crime and smothers in blood the most legal 
and peaceful attempts at emancipation; in defense of justice, outraged without

<p>
respite by the handful of brigands that oppress us, we rebel against the dictator¬ 
ship of Porfirio Diaz, and we will not put down the arms we’ve taken in hand 
with complete justification until, united with the Partido Liberal Mexicano (PLM), 
we’ve made triumph the program promulgated on July 1 of the current year by 
the Organizing Junta of the Partido Liberal. 
</p>

<p>
The excesses committed daily by the dictatorship throughout our unfor¬ 
tunate country, the attacks against electoral rights, against the rights of assembly, 
freedom of the press and freedom of speech, against the freedom to work, the 
massacres with which the government suffocates demonstrations of good citizen¬ 
ship, the murders and the robberies that the authorities cynically commit in all 
parts of the nation, the systematic contempt with which the Mexican is treated 
by the present authorities, the detention of independent citizens, the huge loans 
with which the dictatorship has saddled the nation, with no more object than 
the enrichment of a few oppressors, the indignity of our tyrants who have so¬ 
licited the invasion of our territory by foreign forces, and, in a word, all of this 
accumulation of iniquities, of oppressions, of thefts and crimes of all types which 
characterize the Diaz government, must be stopped and punished by the people, 
who, if during thirty years [of Diaz’s rule] have been respectful and humble in the 
vain hope that their despots would return to proper conduct, today have become 
convinced of their error and have tired of bearing chains, will know how to be 
inflexible in the reclamation of their rights. 
</p>

<p>
The crimes of the dictatorship, growing greater each day, and the impos¬ 
sibility of dealing with them via peaceful means (because many times when wc’vc 
tried to exercise our rights we’ve been trampled on by the tyrants) impel us to 
revolution. Those who see an evil in it can’t blame the people who during thirty

<p>
tyranny which through its unbridled and despotic intolerance has made it neces¬ 
sary for us to recur to force of arms to defend our rights and to realize our just and 
noble aspirations. 
</p>

<p>
There are no personal ambitions behind our movement. We fight for the 
country, for all of the oppressed, for the betterment of political and social condi¬ 
tions in our country, for the benefit of all. Our flag of struggle is that of the Partido 
Liberal. The only authority that we recognize while a government elected by the 
people establishes itself is the Organizing Junta of the Partido Liberal. We’re a frac¬ 
tion of this great party which has fought and will fight until the redemption of 
our country is won, and we work in accord with our coreligionists in the rest of 
the country who, like ourselves, have risen in arms on this same date against the

<p>
present corrupt administration which will not be long in being overthrown and 
which in these moments already trembles before the formidable revolutionary 
movement which shakes the entire territory of the Mexican republic. 
</p>

<p>
We call upon the officers and soldiers of the national army, rather than 
serve the vile dictatorship which dishonors and betrays the nation, to join the 
liberating movement.They are sons of the people like we are; they bear the same 
yoke that crushes all of us; they are also Mexicans and have the duty to fight for 
the dignity and the good of the country, and not for the personal good of a thiev¬ 
ing, bloodthirsty despot like Porfirio Diaz. 
</p>

<p>
The commanders and officers in the service of the dictatorship who pass 
over into the liberal files will be granted a promotion of two ranks above what 
they now have; the plain soldiers will be paid one peso daily with nothing taken 
out; and the noncommissioned officers will be given equivalent salaries. 
</p>

<p>
We advise the foreigners that we intend to do nothing against them, but 
we also remind them of the duty they have to be neutral in the political affairs of 
Mexico, in which they have no right to intervene. We will give to foreign persons 
and properties all the guarantees possible, because in the interest of our beloved 
country and our cause we don’t want to give rise to international conflicts; but 
the foreigners who, lacking neutrality, serve the government and fight against us 
cannot expect any consideration on our part.

MANIFESTO TO THE WORKERS OF THE WORLD 
</p>

<p>
Regeneracion, April 3 , 1911 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
Comrades: 
</p>

<p>
It’s a little more than four months since the red flag of the proletariat 
erupted onto the battlefields of Mexico, carried by emancipated workers whose 
aspirations can be understood from this sublime war cry: Land and Liberty! 
</p>

<p>
The people of Mexico find themselves in these moments in open rebel¬ 
lion against their oppressors, and, taking part in the general insurrection are those 
who sustain modern ideas: those convinced of the fallacy of political remedies as 
a means of redeeming the proletariat from economic slavery; those who do not 
believe in the goodness of paternalistic governments nor in the impartiality of the 
laws worked out by the bourgeoisie; those who know that the emancipation of 
the workers must be accomplished by the workers themselves; those convinced 
</p>


<p>
134 ★ DREAMS OF FREEDOM 
</p>




<p>
of the need for direct action; those who do not recognize the “sacred right of pri¬ 
vate property;” those who have not taken up arms to elevate any boss, but rather 
to destroy wage slavery. These revolutionaries are represented by the Organiz¬ 
ing Junta of the Partido Liberal Mexicano (519 E. 4th St., Los Angeles, California), 
whose official organ ,Regeneration, clearly explains their tendencies. 
</p>

<p>
The Partido Liberal Mexicano does not fight to overthrow the dictator 
Porfirio Diaz in order to put a new tyrant in his place.The Partido Liberal Mexi¬ 
cano is taking part in the present insurrection with the firm and deliberate pur¬ 
pose of expropriating the land and the means of production to deliver them to 
the people, that is, to each and every one of the inhabitants of Mexico, without 
sexual discrimination. We consider this step essential to opening the doors to the 
effective emancipation of the Mexican people. 
</p>

<p>
Now then, another party also finds itself with arms in hand: the Anti-Re¬ 
election Party, whose leader, Francisco I. Madero, is a millionaire who has seen his 
vast fortune grow through the sweat and tears of the peons on his haciendas.This 
party fights to make “effective” the right to vote, and to found, in sum, a bourgeois 
republic such as that in the United States.This party, overall political, is, naturally, 
the enemy of the Partido Liberal Mexicano, because it sees in the activities of 
the liberals a danger to the survival of the bourgeois republic which guarantees 
to the politicians, to the job seekers, to the rich, to all of the ambitious, to those 
who want to live at the cost of the suffering and the slavery of the proletariat 
—it sees a danger to the continuation of social inequality, to the sustenance of 
the capitalist, to the division of the human family into two classes: exploiters and 
exploited. 
</p>

<p>
The dictatorship of Porfirio Diaz is about to fall. But the revolution will 
not end because of this sole fact; upon the grave of this infamous dictatorship will 
remain standing, face to face, with arms in hand, these two social classes: that of 
the well fed and that of the hungry, the first of these intending the preservation 
of its class interests, and the second the abolition of these privileges by means of 
the installation of a system that guarantees to all human beings bread, land, and 
liberty. 
</p>

<p>
This formidable struggle of the two social classes in Mexico is the first 
act in the great universal cataclysm which very soon will break upon the scene 
all over the planet, and whose final act will be the triumph of the magnanimous 
formula of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity which the bourgeois political revolutions 
have not been able to translate into physical reality, because these revolutions 
</p>


<p>
CHAPTER TWO: DOCUMENTS ★ 1 35 
</p>




<p>
have not dared to break to pieces the dorsal spine of tyranny: capitalism and au¬ 
thoritarianism. 
</p>

<p>
Comrades of the entire world: the solution of the social problem is in the 
hands of the disinherited of the entire Earth, because it only requires the practice 
of a great virtue: solidarity Your Mexican brothers have had the courage to hold 
high the red flag; but they haven’t made a display of it in puerile demonstrations 
in the streets and plazas, which almost always end with the arrest and the smash¬ 
ing of the heads of the demonstrators by the cossacks employed by the tyrants. 
Rather, they’ve firmly held the red flag on the battlefields in gallant challenge to 
the old society, as an attempt to plant in solid ground the new just and loving so¬ 
ciety. 
</p>

<p>
Our efforts, as noble and unself-interested as they might be, will be anni¬ 
hilated by the concerted actions of the bourgeoisie of all the nations of the world. 
Due to the sole fact of the red flag being raised on the battlefields of Mexico, the 
American bourgeoisie has forced President Taft to send twenty thousand soldiers 
to the Mexican border and warships to the Mexican ports. Meanwhile, what are 
the workers of the world doing? Crossing their arms and contemplating, as if in 
the seats of a theater, the people and events of this tremendous drama, which 
ought to move all hearts, which ought to elevate all consciences, which ought to 
intensely excite the nerves of all of the dispossessed of the Earth.They ought to 
get up as a single man to stop the squadrons of war and to put a halt to the uni¬ 
formed slaves of all of the countries. 
</p>

<p>
Agitation! This is the supreme resource of the moment. Individual agita¬ 
tion of conscious workers; collective agitation of workers’ and freethought societ¬ 
ies; agitation in the street, in the theater, in the streetcar, in the meeting places, in 
the home, in all places where there are ears to hear, consciences capabie of indig¬ 
nation, hearts which haven’t been hardened by the injustice and brutality of the 
environment; agitation by means of letters, manifestoes, flyers, conferences, meet¬ 
ings, by as many means as possible, making understood the necessity of working 
quickly and with energy in favor of the radical revolutionaries of Mexico who 
need three things: worldwide protest against the intervention of foreign pow¬ 
ers in Mexican affairs; conscious, determined workers to propagate emancipatory 
social doctrines among the unconscious; and money, money, and more money to 
foment the Mexican social revolution. 
</p>

<p>
Comrades, reprint this manifesto, translate it into all languages, and make 
it circulate across all the borders of the Earth. Ask the workers’ press to insert it 
</p>

in their columns, read Regeneration, and send your bit to the Organizing Junta of 
the Partido Liberal Mexicano, 519_ E. 4th St., Los Angeles, California, USA. 
</p>

<p>
Our cause is your cause. It’s the cause of the taciturn slave working the 
earth, the outcast of the workshop and factory, the galley slave of the sea, the 
prisoner working the mine, of all who suffer the iniquity of the capitalist system. 
Our cause is your cause. If you remain inactive when your brothers go to their 
deaths clutching the red flag, you’ll give, through your inaction, a rude blow to the 
proletarian cause.

<p>
We don’t concern ourselves with showing to you that it has been to your 
indifference, to your lack of solidarity, to your ignoring your duty to join together 
to bring about the advent of the revolution, that is owed the lamentable delay of 
the new era, in which will exist the universal country of the free and of broth¬ 
ers. Now you have the social revolution in Mexico in your view. What are you 
waiting for before you go to work? Are you waiting for this noble movement to 
be crushed to fill the air with your protests, which will be impotent to return to 
life your better brothers and to remove from men’s breasts the discouragement 
which would lead to failure, a failure which you yourselves have prepared with 
your indifference? 
</p>

<p>
Meditate on it, comrades, and get to work immediately, without losing 
time, before your aid arrives too late.

Understand the danger in which we find ourselves facing the govern¬

revolution, which is the only thing the powerful of the Earth fear.

<p>
MANIFESTO 
</p>

<p>
September 23, 1911 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
Mexicans: 
</p>

<p>
The Organizing Junta of the Partido Liberal Mexicano views with sympa¬ 
thy your efforts to put into practice the lofty ideals of political, economic, and so¬ 
cial emancipation, whose reign upon the earth will finally put an end to the long 
battle of man against man, which has its origin in the inequality of wealth born of 
the principle of private property. 
</p>

<p>
Abolishing this principle means the annihilation of all political, econom¬ 
ic, social, religious, and moral institutions that comprise the ambient within which 
free initiative and the free association of human beings are smothered—human 
beings who see themselves obligated, in order to avoid perishing, to undertake a 
bloody competition from which exit triumphantly not the good, not the self-deny¬ 
ing, not the most gifted physically, morally, or intellectually, but rather the most 
cunning, the most egotistical, the least scrupulous, the hardest of heart, and those 
who place their personal well-being above any consideration of human solidarity 
or justice. 
</p>

<p>
Without the principle of private property there would be no reason for 
government, which is necessary solely for the purpose of keeping the disinher¬ 
ited within bounds in their quarrels or in their rebellions against those who hold 
the social wealth; neither would there be reason for the church, whose only ob¬ 
ject is to strangle the innate human rebellion against oppression and exploitation 
through the preaching of patience, resignation, and humility, and through quieting 
the call of the most powerful and fertile of instincts through immoral, cruel, and 
unhealthy penances; and so that the poor will not aspire to enjoying the good 
things of the earth and thus constitute a danger to the privileges of the rich, 
the church promises to the humble, to the most resigned, to the most patient, a 
heaven extending to infinity, beyond the stars one can see &#x2026; 
</p>

<p>
Capital, Authority, Clergy: this is the dark trinity which makes of this 
beautiful earth a paradise for those who have managed to clutch in their claws, 
through cunning, violence, and crime, the product of the sweat, blood, tears, and 
sacrifice of thousands of generations of workers; and these same three things 
create a hell for those with whose arms and minds work the earth, operate the 
machinery, build the houses, and transport the products. In this manner human- 
</p>


<p>
138 ★ DREAMS OF FREEDOM 
</p>




<p>
ity is divided into two classes with diametrically opposite interests: the capitalist 
class and the working class; the class which possesses the lands, the machinery of 
production, and the means of transporting wealth, and the class which has noth¬ 
ing other than its arms and minds to provide sustenance. 
</p>

<p>
Between these two social classes there cannot exist any ties of friendship 
or fraternity, because the possessing class is always disposed to perpetuate the 
economic, political, and social system that guarantees it the tranquil enjoyment 
of its plunders, while the working class makes efforts to destroy this iniquitous 
system in order to install one in which the lands, the houses, the machinery of 
production, and the means of transport are for everyone’s use. 
</p>

<p>
Mexicans.The Partido Liberal Mexicano recognizes that every human be¬ 
ing, by the simple fact of coming to life, has the right to enjoy each and every one 
of the advantages that modern civilization offers, because these advantages are 
the product of the effort and sacrifice of the working class in all ages. 
</p>

<p>
The Partido Liberal Mexicano recognizes that work is necessary to sub¬ 
sistence, and therefore all, with the exception of the old, the physically impaired, 
and children, must dedicate themselves to producing something useful in order 
to provide necessities. 
</p>

<p>
The Partido Liberal Mexicano recognizes that the so-called right of in¬ 
dividual property is an iniquitous right, because it subjects the larger number of 
human beings to work and to suffer to satisfy and keep in idleness a small number 
of capitalists. 
</p>

<p>
The Partido Liberal Mexicano recognizes that Authority and the Clergy 
are the support for the iniquity of Capital, and therefore the Organizing Junta of 
the Partido Liberal Mexicano has declared solemn war upon Authority, Capital, 
and the Clergy. 
</p>

<p>
Against Capital, Authority, and Clergy the Partido Liberal Mexicano has 
raised the red banner on the fields of action in Mexico, where our brothers battle 
like lions, contesting victory from the followers of the bourgeoisie, be they fol¬ 
lowers of Madero, Reyes, Vazquez, or be they “cientificos” or any others whose 
only purpose is to elevate some man to the head of state or to conduct some 
shadowy business without consideration of the entire Mexican population; and 
they all recognize as sacred, every one of them, the right of individual property. 
</p>

<p>
In these moments of confusion, so propitious for attacking oppression 
and exploitation; in these moments in which Authority, broken, reeling, vacillat¬ 
ing, harassed on all sides by the forces of unleashed passions, by the tempest of 
appetites revived by the hope of a coming feast; in these moments of sinking 
</p>


<p>
CHAPTER TWO: DOCUMENTS ★ 1 39 
</p>




<p>
feelings, of anxiousness, or terror for all the privileged, the compact masses of the 
disinherited invade the lands, burn the property titles, place their creative hands 
upon the fertile earth, and shake their fists at everything that was respectable yes¬ 
terday: Authority, Capital, and Clergy; they open the furrow, spread the seed, and 
wait, emotionally, for the first fruits of free labor. 
</p>

<p>
These are, Mexicans, the first practical results of the propaganda and the 
actions of the soldiers of the proletariat, of the noble holders of our egalitarian 
principles, of our brothers who defy all impositions and all exploitation with the 
cry of death to those above and life and hope for those below: Long live Land and 
Liberty! 
</p>

<p>
The storm grows fiercer day by day: partisans of Madero, Vazquez, Reyes, 
De la Barra, and the “cientificos” call to you, Mexicans, to fly to defend their faded 
flags, to protect the privileges of the capitalist class. Don’t listen to the sweet 
songs from these sirens who want to take advantage of your sacrifices in order to 
establish a government, that is, a new dog to protect the interests of the rich. On 
your feet everyone!—but in order to bring about the expropriation of the goods 
kept for themselves by the rich! 
</p>

<p>
Expropriation must be carried out through blood and fire during the 
course of this great movement, as is being done by our brothers, the inhabitants 
of Morelos, Southern Puebla, Michoacan, Guerrero,Veracruz, NorthernTamaulipas, 
Durango, Sonora, Sinaloa, Jalisco, Chihuahua, Oaxaca, Yucatan, Quintana Roo and 
regions of other states, as even the Mexican bourgeois press has to confess, in 
which the proletarians have taken possession ot the lands without waiting for 
some paternal government to decree that they’re worthy of happiness, conscious 
that they cannot expect anything good from governments and that “the emancipa¬ 
tion of the workers must be the task of the workers themselves.” 
</p>

<p>
These first acts of expropriation have been crowned by the smile of suc¬ 
cess; but it’s not necessary to limit oneself to taking possession of the lands and 
agricultural implements; it’s necessary that the workers themselves determinedly 
take possession of all the industries, ensuring in this manner that the lands, mines, 
factories, workshops, foundries, cars, railways, ships, warehouses of all kinds, and 
the houses remain in the power of each and every one of the inhabitants of Mex¬ 
ico, without sexual discrimination. 
</p>

<p>
The inhabitants of each region in which such an act of supreme justice 
is carried out have nothing else to do but to come to an accord that all the things 
found in the stores, warehouses, granaries, etc. be taken to a place easily acces¬ 
sible to all, where men and women of good will will take a careful inventory of 
</p>


<p>
140 ★ DREAMS OF FREEDOM 
</p>




<p>
everything that’s been gathered in order to calculate how long these things will 
last, taking into account the needs and the number of inhabitants who need to 
make use of these things, from the moment of expropriation until the first harvest 
is taken from the fields and the other industries produce the first articles. 
</p>

<p>
With the inventory taken, the workers in the different industries will 
come to a fraternal understanding among themselves on the management of pro¬ 
duction. In this manner, during the course of this movement, no one will lack 
anything, and the only ones who die of hunger will be those who don’t want to 
work, with the exceptions of the old, the handicapped, and the children, who will 
have the right to the use of everything. 
</p>

<p>
All that is produced will be sent to central community warehouses from 
which everyone will have the right to take everything that they need, according 
to their needs, with no other requirement than that they show proof that they 
work in one or another industry. 
</p>

<p>
The aspiration of the human being is to have the maximum amount of 
enjoyment with the minimal amount of effort, and the best way to ensure this 
result is to work the land and the other industries in common. If the land is di¬ 
vided and each family has a plot, besides the grave danger of falling again into the 
capitalist system—because there will be no lack of cunning men or of those in 
the habit of saving who will manage to amass more than others and eventually 
will be able to exploit their brothers—there is also the fact that if a family works 
a plot of land, it will have to work more or less like it does today under the system 
of private property in order to obtain the same mean result. While if the land is 
held and worked in common, the workers will labor less and produce more. Of 
course there will be no lack of land for everyone to have their own house, as well 
as a good plot to put to use however they want.The same can be said of working 
the factories, workshops, etc., as of working the land. But each person, according 
to his temperament, desires, and abilities will have to choose the type of work he 
wants to do, and with this enough will be produced to cover his necessities, and 
to ensure that he won’t be a burden on the community. 
</p>

<p>
Working in the manner indicated, that is, following immediately after 
the expropriation of production, free of bosses and based upon the needs of the 
inhabitants of every region, no one will lack anything despite the armed move¬ 
ment, until, with the end of this movement and with the end of the last member 
of the bourgeoisie and the last representative of authority, with the law sustaining 
privilege broken into pieces and with everything in the hands of those who work, 
all of us will stretch our arms in a fraternal embrace and celebrate with cries of 
</p>


<p>
CHAPTER TWO: DOCUMENTS ★ 141 
</p>




<p>
jubilation the installation of a system which guarantees every human being bread 
and liberty 
</p>

<p>
Mexicans: This is what the Partido Liberal Mexicano fights for. This is 
what the pleiades of heroes shed their blood for.This is what is fought for under 
the renowned cry,“Land and Liberty!” 
</p>

<p>
The liberals haven’t put down their arms despite the treaties between 
the traitor Madero and the tyrant Diaz, and despite, also, the urgings of the bour¬ 
geoisie who have tried to fill the liberals’ pockets with gold.This is because the 
liberals are men who are convinced that political liberty will not be taken advan¬ 
tage of by the poor, but rather by the seekers after offices, and our object is not 
to obtain offices or honors, but rather to snatch everything from the hands of the 
bourgeoisie so that everything will be in the hands of the workers. 
</p>

<p>
The activity of the various political bands in these moments is in dispute 
of supremacy, that is, following the triumph, who will do exactly the same thing 
as Porfirio Diaz, because no man, no matter how well intentioned he might be, 
can do anything in favor of the poor once in power. But this political activity has 
produced the chaos of which the disinherited can take advantage, that is, taking 
advantage of the special circumstances in which the country finds itself in order 
to put into practice on the march, without wasting time, the sublime ideals of the 
Partido Liberal Mexicano, without waiting for peace to carry out expropriation. 
Because if we wait, by then the provisions in the stores, granaries, warehouses, 
and other places will have been exhausted, and at the same time, because of the 
state of war in which the country finds itself, production will have been suspend¬ 
ed and hunger will result; but if we carry out expropriation and organize work 
in a free manner during the revolutionary movement, no one will lack what he 
needs during the movement or thereafter. 
</p>

<p>
Mexicans: if you want to be free, do not fight for any cause other than 
that of the Partido Liberal Mexicano. Everyone offers you political liberty after 
the triumph: the liberals invite you to take the lands, the machinery, the means of 
transport, and the houses immediately, without waiting for anyone to give you all 
this, without waiting for some law to decree these things, because the laws are not 
made by the poor, but rather by the frock-coated bosses who guard well against 
making laws to the disadvantage of their own caste. 
</p>

<p>
It’s the duty of all the poor to work and to struggle to break the chains 
that enslave us. To leave the solution of our problems to the educated and rich 
classes is to voluntarily put ourselves in the grasp of their claws. We are the plebe¬ 
ians; the ragged; the hungry; those who don’t have a clod of dirt on which to lay 
</p>


<p>
142 ★ DREAMS OF FREEDOM 
</p>




<p>
our heads; those who live tormented by the uncertainty of having bread for our 
women and children; those who, when we become old, are fired ignominiously 
because we can no longer work.We must look to our own powerful efforts, our 
thousand sacrifices to destroy to its foundation the edifice of the old society 
which has been until now a caring mother for the rich and a wicked and evil 
stepmother to those who work and are good. 
</p>

<p>
All of the evils that afflict the human being originate in the present sys¬ 
tem, which obliges the majority of humanity to work and to sacrifice itself so that 
a privileged minority has all of its needs, and even its caprices, filled, while living 
in idleness and vice. And it wouldn’t be so bad if all the poor were assured of 
work; but production is not arranged to satisfy the needs of the workers, but rath¬ 
er to provide profits to the bourgeoisie, who take pains not to produce more than 
they can afford; and from this results the periodic work stoppages in industry or 
restrictions on the number of workers, which also comes from the improvements 
in machinery which supplant the arms of the proletariat. 
</p>

<p>
To put an end to all this it’s necessary that the workers have in their 
hands the lands and the machinery of production, and that it be themselves 
who organize the production of the wealth while paying attention to their own 
needs. 
</p>

<p>
Robbery, prostitution, murder, arson, and swindles are all products of the 
system which places men and women in conditions under which, if they don’t 
want to die of hunger, they are obligated to seize what they can or to prostitute 
themselves, since in the majority of cases, even if they have a great desire to work 
they can’t find it, or the pay is so low that their wages don’t cover even the most 
urgent necessities of the individual and the family; and the hours of labor under 
the capitalist system and the conditions under which it is carried out destroy the 
health of the worker in little time, if they don’t kill him outright in an industrial 
accident which has no other origin than the contempt with which the capitalist 
class views those who sacrifice themselves for the benefit of the capitalists. 
</p>

<p>
The poor man, angered by the injustice of which he’s the object; cho¬ 
leric before the insulting luxury which those who do nothing flash before him; 
beaten in the streets by the police for the crime of being poor; obligated to rent 
his body to work at jobs he dislikes; badly paid; despised by all those who know 
more than he does or by those who believe themselves superior because of their 
money; contemplating a sad old age and the death of an animal dispatched from 
the stable for being unfit to serve; nervous about the possibility of being without 
work from one day to the next; obliged to see as enemies the members of his

<p>
CHAPTER TWO: DOCUMENTS ★ 143 
</p>




<p>
class, because he doesn’t know if they will be the ones who rent themselves to 
the capitalists for less than he does—it’s natural that under these circumstances 
antisocial instincts develop in the human being, instincts which are unleashed in 
crime, prostitution, and betrayal: the fruits of the old, hateful system which we 
want to eradicate down to its deepest roots in order to create a new system of 
love, equality, justice, fraternity, and liberty. 
</p>

<p>
Let everyone arise as a single man! In the reach of all are tranquility, 
well-being, liberty, the satisfaction of all healthy appetites—but not if we allow 
ourselves to be guided by rulers. Let everyone be the master of himself. Let every¬ 
thing be arranged by mutual consent between free individuals. Death to slavery! 
Death to hunger! Long live Land and Liberty! 
</p>

<p>
Mexicans:With our hands placed on our hearts and our consciences tran¬ 
quil, we’re making a formal and solemn call for you—everyone, men and women 
—to adopt the lofty ideals of the Partido Liberal Mexicano. While there are poor 
and rich, rulers and ruled, there will be no peace, nor is peace to be desired, be¬ 
cause such peace would be founded in the political, economic, and social inequal¬ 
ity of millions of human beings who suffer hunger, outrages, prison, and death, 
while a tiny minority enjoys all types of pleasures and freedom for doing noth¬ 
ing. 
</p>

<p>
To the struggle! Expropriate with the ideal of benefitting all, and not just 
a few, so that this war will not be a war of bandits, but of men and women who de¬

<p>
MANIFESTO TO THE ANARCHISTS OF THE ENTIRE 
WORLD AND TO THE WORKERS IN GENERAL 
</p>

<p>
Regeneration, March 16, 1918 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
The clock of history is close to marking, with its inexorable hand, the 
instant that this society going through its death throes expires. 
</p>

<p>
The death of the old society is close, it won’t be long in coming, and the 
only ones who can deny this fact are those who want it to live, those who draw 
advantage from the injustice on which it is based, those who view with horror 
the social revolution, because they know that on the day after it comes they will 
have to work elbow to elbow with their slaves of the evening before. 
</p>

<p>
Everything strongly indicates that the death of bourgeois society won’t 
be long in coming.The citizen looks grimly upon the policeman, who yesterday 
he considered his protector and a source of aid; the assiduous reader of the bour¬ 
geois press shrugs his shoulders and contemptuously throws down the prosti¬ 
tuted sheets in which appear the declarations of the heads of state; the worker 
goes on strike without it mattering to him that his attitude harms “the national 
interest,” conscious now that the nation isn’t his property, but the property of the 
rich; in the streets one sees faces that clearly betray inner discontent, and there 
are arms that appear to be itching to construct barricades.There are whispers in 
the bars; whispers in the theater; whispers on the streetcars; and in every home, 
especially in our homes, in the homes of those on the bottom, there are laments 
about a son sent off to war; and the hearts grow heavy and the eyes fill with tears 
thinking that tomorrow, and perhaps even today, the big boy who is the life of 
the hovel, the youth who with his impudence and grace wraps in the colors of 
the rainbow the sad existence of his parents who are in their declining years, will 
be yanked from the loving breast of the family to go to confront, gun in hand, 
another youth who is, like him, the light of his home, and whom he doesn’t hate 
and can’t hate, because he doesn’t even know him. 
</p>

<p>
The flames of discontent are blown by the winds of tyranny, constantly 
growing stronger and cruder throughout the country, and here, there, and yon¬ 
der, everywhere, fists are clinching, minds are getting wrought up, hearts are beat¬ 
ing violently, and there isn’t murmuring, there is shouting, a yearning for the mo¬ 
ment in which the callused hands hardened by a hundred centuries of labor have

<p>
to put down the useful tool in order to raise the rifle that awaits, impatiently, the 
earess of the hero. 
</p>

<p>
Comrades: the moment is solemn; this moment is the precursor of the 
greatest political and social cataclysm recorded in history: the insurrection of all 
the peoples against existing conditions. 
</p>

<p>
It will be, surely, a blind impulse of the suffering masses; it will be, un¬ 
doubtedly, a chaotic explosion of anger, menaced hardly at all by the revolver of 
the thug and the noose of the hangman; it will be an overflow of indignation and 
bitterness, and it will produce chaos, chaos favorable to the prosperity of all of the 
fishermen in the river of revolt, chaos from which can surge new oppressions and 
new tyrannies, because in this chaos, regularly, the leader is a charlatan. 
</p>

<p>
Let us then, those who are conscious, prepare the popular mentality for 
when the moment arrives, because if we don’t prepare for the insurrection it will 
give rise anew to tyranny. 
</p>

<p>
Let us prepare the people not only so that they will tranquilly await the 
great events which we glimpse, but so that they will be capable of refusing to al¬ 
low themselves to be dragged along the primrose path by those who would lead 
them to an identical state of slavery or a tyranny similar to that which we now 
suffer. 
</p>

<p>
In order to ensure that unconscious rebellion doesn’t form with its own 
arms the new chain that will again enslave the people, it’s necessary that we, 
those who do not believe in government, those who are convinced that govern¬ 
ment, whatever its form and wherever it shows its face, is tyranny, because it is 
not an institution created to protect the weak, but rather to protect the strong, 
place ourselves at the forefront of circumstances and fearlessly proclaim our holy 
anarchist ideal, the only human, just, and true ideal. 
</p>

<p>
Not to do so is to knowingly betray the slumbering aspirations of the 
people for liberty without limits other than the natural ones, that is, a liberty 
which does not endanger the preservation of the species. 
</p>

<p>
Not to do so is to leave the sacrifice of the humble in the hands of those 
who would want to take advantage of it for purely personal ends. 
</p>

<p>
Not to do so is to affirm what our opponents say, that the time when our 
ideal can take root is still distant. 
</p>

<p>
Activity, activity, and still more activity, that is what the moment de¬ 
mands. 
</p>


<p>

<p>
Let every man and every woman who loves the anarchist ideal proclaim 
it with tenacity, with stubbornness, taking no notice of taunts, without fearing 
dangers, without regard to the consequences. 
</p>

<p>
Shoulders to the wheel, comrades, and the future will be the unfolding of 
our ideal.

THE REVOLUTION 
</p>



<p>
CLARION CALL TO ARMS 
</p>

<p>
Revolucion, June 1, 1907 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
It’s a lie that virtue resides in the suffering, pious, and obedient spirits! 
</p>

<p>
It’s a lie that meekness is a sign of goodness. It’s a lie that to love our 
fellow men, that to yearn to alleviate their pains and to sacrifice onself for their 
well-being is a quality only of the peaceful, tender, eternally kneeling, eternally 
submissive souls! 
</p>

<p>
What is a duty to suffer without losing all hope, to feel upon oneself the 
whiplash of inclemency, without repelling the aggression, without even a glance 
of defiance? 
</p>

<p>
What a poor morality that encloses virtue in the circle of obedience and 
resignation! 
</p>

<p>
What an ignoble doctrine that repudiates the right to resist and insists on 
denying the virtue of the combative spirits who do not tolerate outrages and who 
refuse to surrender their free wills! 
</p>

<p>
It is not true that submission reveals lofty sentiments; on the contrary, 
submission is the lowest form of egoism: it is fear. 
</p>

<p>
The submissive are those who lack sufficient moral development to sub¬ 
ordinate their self-preservation to the demands of human dignity; those who flee 
sacrifice and danger, yet sink themselves in opprobrium; those incorrigible cow¬ 
ards who in all times have been a grave obstacle to the triumph of liberating 
ideas. 
</p>

<p>
The submissive are traitors to progress, the contemptible stragglers who 
retard the march of humanity. 
</p>

<p>
Never has altruism budded in these morbid, terrified temperaments; al¬ 
truism is the patrimony of strong characters, of those abnegating individuals who 
love others too much to forget about themselves. 
</p>

<p>
It’s a lie that submission is an act worthy of praise; it’s a lie that sub¬ 
mission is proof of spiritual health! Those who submit, those who renounce the 
exercise of their rights, are not only weak, they are also detestable.To offer one’s 
neck to the yoke without protest, without anger, is to castrate the most precious 
potencies of a man, to make a work of degradation, of one’s own debasement; it’s 
to make oneself infamous and to merit the contempt which bites and the hatred 
which tortures. 
</p>


<p>
150 ★ DREAMS OF FREEDOM 
</p>





<p>
There’s no virtue in being servile. In this bitter epoch of injustice and 
oppression, it’s necessary to raise one’s gaze to the shining heights, to the free 
minds, to the combative souls. 
</p>

<p>
The serene apostles who preach that peace and good have conquered 
death; those who offer themselves up for sacrifice; those who believe that to sac¬ 
rifice themselves marching defenseless to martyrdom;those embodying Christian 
virtues are not sprouting up nor are they necessary in our day: this caste of strug¬ 
gles has self-extinguished, has disappeared forever, enveloped in a shroud of their 
mystic errors.Through their example they leave us a living proof that meekness 
is death. They preached and they suffered. They were insulted, spit upon, trod 
upon, and they never raised an indignant glance.The development of their ideas 
was slow and very hard; their triumph impossible. They lacked the violence to 
demolish the castles of reaction, the war-like vigor to knock down the enemy and 
to raise with fierce fist the liberating banner. Their sheep-like example doesn’t 
seduce the new ranks of reformers, elevated by their devotion to the ideal, but 
perfectly educated in the school of resistance and of attack. 
</p>

<p>
To fight for a redemptory idea is to practice the noblest of the virtues: 
that of fertile and disinterested sacrifice. But to fight is not to deliver oneself to 
martyrdom or to look for death.To fight is to fight to win. Fighting is life, bristling, 
roaring life which abominates suicide and knows how to wound and how to tri¬ 
umph. 
</p>

<p>
Let us fight for liberty; let them come to our ranks—the modern evange¬ 
lists, strong and beneficent, those who preach and act, the libertarians with clear 
consciousness who know how to sacrifice everything for principle, for the love 
of humanity. Let those come who are disposed to disdain danger and to tread on 
the sands of combat where there will be scenes of fatally necessary barbarism, 
and where valor is acclaimed and where heroism has its seductive apotheosis. 
</p>

<p>
Let join the cultivators of the ideal, those emancipated from fear, which 
is black egoism! Join! There is no time to lose! 
</p>

<p>
To conceive an idea is to commence to make it real .To remain quiescent, 
not to execute the deep-felt ideal, is not to drive it forward; to put it in practice, 
to make it real on all occasions and in every moment of life is to work in accord 
with what one says and preaches.To think and to act in harmony should be the 
work of the thinkers; to dare always and to work on all occasions should be the 
labor of the soldiers of liberty. 
</p>

<p>
Abnegation pushes one to combat: let us hasten to fight for more than 
ourselves, for our children, for the generations to come, who will call at our crypts 
to scoff at us if we remain petrified, if we don’t destroy this regime of abjection in

<p>
which we live, but who will salute us with affection if we agitate, if we are loyal 
to the glorious shield behind which humanity advances. 
</p>

<p>
Let us work for the future, to save our posterity from pain. It is force 
which will destroy this slave pit of shame and misery; it is force which will pre¬ 
pare the advent of a new, egalitarian, happy society. 
</p>

<p>
It doesn’t matter if we perish in the hazardous battle if we have gained 
the noblest satisfaction in life: the satisfaction that in our name history will speak 
to the man of tomorrow, emancipated through our efforts. 
</p>

PREACHING PEACE IS A CRIME 
</p>

<p>
Regeneracion, September 17, 1910 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
Pale and shaking, eyes darting from side to side, lips trembling, a man, 
dragging his feet as if they were made of lead, stumbles his way through the 
crowd to the podium: Fear is going to speak. He preaches the philosophy of four- 
footed beasts.“Peace is good, he says;peace is a great good. Life is sweet and agree¬ 
able,” he continues,“let us care well, then, for life.” 
</p>

<p>
Moments before, the loftiest orators had shaken that multitude, and hero 
ism, fearlessness, and revolutionary audacity had resonated in the souls of the 
crowd, in the souls of workers, in the souls of crushed spirits who, at the cry of re¬ 
bellion, had felt rise within the most hidden corners of their beings the eagerness 
of heroes, the courage of the valiant. One more cry and these slaves would have 
angrily thrown off the burden which keeps them in subjection more effectively 
than the prison and the scaffold: respect for those above them. But Fear becomes 
manifest and speaks; its words pass over their heads like the winds of winter; and 
their enthusiasm dims; their burning eagerness becomes numbed; and those hu¬ 
man beings who had arrived at the gates of heroism and had already crossed its 
threshold open their eyes in fright and retreat, to fall once again humiliated and 
submissive at the feet of their bosses, repeating these damnable words: “Peace is 
good; peace is a great good.” 
</p>


<p>
152 ★ DREAMS OF FREEDOM 
</p>





<p>
This is the history of all human efforts toward attaining freedom and 
happiness. Put your life and well-being at risk says the apostle. The slaves stand 
straighter and listen. The living words of the apostle fall upon their saddened 
souls like a healing salve. It’s consoling to know that everyone, simply by the fact 
of being born, has the right to live and to be happy. We aren’t happy? It’s because 
someone has put obstacles in the way of being happy. And the apostle speaks 
then of the boss, of the priest, of the soldier, of the ruler. These have weighed 
down the worker since the appearance of the first thief who said, “This piece 
of earth is mine;” and since then they have capriciously weighed down human 
intelligence, frightening some with the specter of hell and terrorizing others with 
the fear of jail and death. From this derives the devout respect for the powerful; 
respect for the priest who treats workers like brutes; respect for the soldier who 
kills; respect for the ruler who oppresses; respect for the boss who lives off the 
labor of the dispossessed. And this respect, prescribed by the law, is so admirably 
arranged that it benefits only those on top and works against only those on the 
bottom. It oppresses humankind, makes it a race of slaves; it corrupts because it 
takes away the right of free inquiry; it snatches away the prerogative of enjoying 
all the good that nature gives us; it mars civilization and makes a man incapable 
of looking up and staring his oppressors in the eye. 
</p>

<p>
The apostle speaks against this respect, and his words are injections of 
healthy sanity that invigorate the multitudes. The desire to be free takes them 
over, and the immortal spirit of justice seizes them so that in the end they decide 
to uproot this respect from the hearts of men. But then Fear speaks, and terrorizes 
their hearts; the firmest arms let fall in discouragement the weapons of liberation, 
and the debased lips spout one after another the hateful words:“Life is sweet and 
agreeable; let us care well, then, for life.” 
</p>

<p>
And so to preach peace is a crime.To preach peace when the tyrant im¬ 
poses his will and humiliates us; when the rich extort us to the extent of turning 
us into slaves; when the government, big business, and the church kill all aspira¬ 
tion and all hope; to preach peace under such circumstances is cowardly, vile, 
criminal. Peace in chains is an affront that should be refused. There is peace in 
the dungeon; there is peace in the cemetery; there is peace in the convent. But 
this peace is not life; this peace does not elevate; this is the peace of Porfirio Diaz, 
the peace in which the eunuch thrives and the citizenry prostitutes itself. It’s the 
peace of the pharaohs, the peace of the tsars, the peace of the Caesars, the peace 
of oriental satraps. Let such a peace be damned! 
</p>


<p>
CHAPTER THREE: THE REVOLUTION ★ 153 
</p>




<p>
Everyone who walks on two legs should rebel against such a peace. Death 
in the midst of revolution is sweeter than life in the midst of oppression. “Liberty 
or death "ought to be our cry, and upon hearing it we should rise first to crush the 
cowards who preach peace, and then the tyrants. 
</p>

<p>
First the cowards, because they are the most certain support for all des¬ 
potisms and the most dangerous enemies of all progress. “Blasphemy!” cry the 
cowards. Yes, blessed blasphemy replies the revolutionary; creative blasphemy; 
farseeing blasphemy; wise blasphemy; just blasphemy. This blasphemy puts its 
hands on all the altars and thrones of the earth and smashes them into pieces. 
This blasphemy elevates itself to heaven where another court, the celestial, rules, 
and breaks it into pieces through reason and leaves in its place bodily souls whose 
chemical composition is known; this blasphemy removes the brake of ignorance 
which made the Earth a fixed point in space and allows it to assume its glorious el¬ 
lipse around the sun; and this blasphemy seizes the lightning of Jove and reduces 
it to electricity in Leyden’s jars. And this tireless and audacious blasphemy, after 
reaching into the heavens and dethroning gods; after unchaining the blind forces 
of nature; after having exposed the fraud of “divine right” of the kings of Earth; 
after having searched the seas to find the original protoplasm, or the tiniest root 
of the zoological tree whose most attractive fruit is the human being, rises calmly, 
with the august serenity of science, to ask of Capital this simple question : 11 Why do 
you rule?” 
</p>

<p>
Revolutionary workers: Cultivate disrespect.

<p>
The well ripened fruit of internal revolt is about to fall. It’s a bitter fruit 
for all those who were pampered in a situation that produced honors, riches, and 
distinction for some based upon the pain and suffering of the rest of humanity. 
But it’s a sweet fruit for those who for whatever reason have felt their dignity 
trampled upon for thirty-four years by the hooves of those who have robbed,

</p>




<p>
raped, killed, swindled, and betrayed, and who have hidden their crimes beneath 
the mantle of the law, avoiding punishment through their official standing. 
</p>

<p>
Who fears the revolution? The same people who have provoked it— 
those who through their oppression or exploitation of the masses have made 
desperation overtake the victims of their infamies, those who through their injus¬ 
tice and greed have incited those with consciences to revolt and have made the 
honorable men of the earth turn pale with indignation. 
</p>

<p>
The revolution is going to break out at any moment. Those of us who 
have followed all of the events in the social and political life of the Mexican 
people cannot deceive ourselves about this. The symptoms of this formidable 
cataclysm leave no doubt that something will surge forth and something will 
come tumbling down, that something will rise and something will fall. Finally, 
after thirty-four years of shame, the Mexican people will raise their heads, and, 
finally, after this long night, the black edifice, the nightmare which has smothered 
us will be smashed into ruins. 
</p>

<p>
It’s proper, now, to say once again what we’ve said so many times before: 
it’s necessary to make sure that this movement, caused by desperation, is not 
simply a blind movement aimed at ridding ourselves of the burden weighing us 
down, that it not be a movement in which instinct almost completely dominates 
reason. We libertarians ought to strive that the orientation of this movement be 
that indicated by science. If we don’t do this, the revolution which is coming 
will serve no other purpose than to replace one president with another, or that 
which is the same, one boss with another.We ought to keep in mind that what is 
needed is that the people have bread, shelter, and land to cultivate; we ought to 
keep in mind that no government, no matter how good its intents, can declare the 
abolition of misery. It’s the people itself, the hungry, the dispossessed who must 
abolish misery, taking, in the first place, possession of the earth which, by natural 
right, cannot be monopolized by a few, but is the property of every human being. 
It’s not possible to predict where the work of reclamation will take the coming 
revolution; but if we who struggle in its ranks carry in good faith the purpose of 
advancing as far along this road as is possible; if upon taking up the Winchester 
we go forth decided, not upon the enthronement of another boss, but upon the 
reclamation of the rights of the people; if we carry to the field of battle the pledge 
of conquering economic liberty, which is the basis of all liberties, which is the 
condition without which there is no liberty whatsoever; if we carry this purpose 
we will channel the coming popular movement upon a course worthy of this 
epoch. But if because of the desire for an easy triumph; if because we want to ab-

<p>
CHAPTER THREE: THE REVOLUTION ★ 155 
</p>




<p>
breviate the conflict we moderate our radical tendencies, which are incompatible 
with the tendencies of the bourgeois and conservative parties, then we will have 
done the work of bandits and murderers, because the blood which has been shed 
will serve no more purpose than to give greater power to the bourgeoisie, that is, 
to the class which possesses wealth and which will, after the triumph, once again 
put the chains on the proletarians whose blood, sacrifice and martyrdom brought 
it to power. 
</p>

<p>
It is necessary, then, proletarians, it is necessary, then, you dispossessed, 
that you not be confused.The conservative and bourgeois parties speak to you of 
liberty, of justice, of law, of honest government, and they tell you that if the people 
exchange the men currently in power for others, that you will have liberty, justice, 
law, honest government. Don’t allow yourselves to be swindled. What you need is 
that which will ensure the well-being of your families and your daily bread; and 
no government can provide the well-being of families. It is you yourselves who 
must conquer these things, taking immediately the possession of the earth, which 
is the primordial wellspring of riches; and no government can give you the land. 
Understand this well! The law defends the “right” of those who hold the wealth. 
You have to take it yourselves despite the law, despite the supposed right of pri¬ 
vate property; you have to take it yourselves in the name of natural justice, in the 
name of the right of every human being to live and develop his body and mind. 
</p>

<p>
When you are in possession of the land, you will have liberty, you will 
have justice, because liberty and justice cannot be decreed: they are the result 
of economic independence, that is, the ability of an individual to live without 
depending on a boss, the ability of an individual to receive the full product of his 
labors. 
</p>

<p>
So then, lake the lands.The iaw says that you can’t take them, that they’re 
private property; but that law was written by those who hold you in slavery and 
as such does not represent a social necessity that requires the force of arms to 
uphold it. If the law were the result of the consent of all, it wouldn’t need the 
support of the police, the jailer, the judge, the hangman, the soldier, and the appa¬ 
ratchik. The law is imposed on you; and against these arbitrary impositions, upheld 
by force, we honorable men should respond by rebelling. 
</p>

<p>
Now: to the struggle! The revolution, uncontainable, inevitable, will not 
be long in arriving. If you want to be truly free, gather together beneath the ban¬ 
ners of the Partido Liberal; but if you only want the strange pleasure of shedding 
blood and playing at soldiers, gather together under other banners: those of the 
anti-re-electionists for example, who after you play at soldiers will bestow on you 
</p>


<p>
156 ★ DREAMS OF FREEDOM

<p>
once again the yoke of your bosses and the yoke of government—that is, in the 
end, you will have had the pleasure of kicking out the old president, who still an¬ 
noys us, with a bright, shiny new one. 
</p>

<p>
Comrades: the question is grave. I understand that you are disposed to 
fight; but fight for the good of the poor. Until now the upper classes have taken 
advantage of all revolutions because you didn’t have a clear idea of your rights 
and interests which, as you know, are completely opposite those of the rich and 
the intelligentsia. The interest of the rich is that the poor be poor eternally, be¬ 
cause the poverty of the masses is the guarantee of their riches. If there weren’t 
men who must work for others, the rich would find themselves obligated to do 
something useful, to produce something of value in the struggle for life; then they 
wouldn’t have slaves to exploit. 
</p>

<p>
I repeat, it’s not possible to predict where the revolutionary reclamations 
of the people will take us; but it’s necessary to procure the most that is possible. 
It would be a great step forward if the lands were the property of all. And if there 
wouldn’t be sufficient force or sufficient consciousness among the revolutionar¬ 
ies to obtain more advantages than this, it would at least be the basis for further, 
future reclamations taken by the people by force. 
</p>

<p>
Forward comrades! Soonyou will hear the first shots;soon the oppressed 
will cry out in rebellion. Let there be no one who fails to rally to this movement 
launched with all of the force of this grand cry: Land and Liberty!

From high on his rock the Old Buzzard [Porfirio Diaz] watches. An un¬ 
settling clarity begins to dissipate the shadows on the horizon surrounding the 
Crime, and in the washed-out countryside he begins to see the silhouette of an 
advancing giant. It’s the Insurrection. 
</p>

<p>
The Old Buzzard sinks down into the abyss of his own consciousness, 
stirring up the mud at its absolute bottom. But he finds nothing in those dark 
depths that explains the rebellion. He resorts then to his memories: men, things, 
dates, circumstances pass through his mind like a line of dancers.The martyrs of

Veracruz pass, showing the wounds on their bodies that they received one night 
by the light of a lantern in the courtyard of a barracks from drunken soldiers com¬ 
manded by an officer who was also drunk on wine and fear.The workers of “The 
Republican” pass, pale, their clothes and bodies cut into shreds by the sabers and 
bayonets of their bosses. The families of Papaatla pass by, old men, women, and 
children riddled by bullets. The miners of Cananea pass by, sublime in their sacri¬ 
fice, gushing blood.The workers of Rio Blanco pass, magnificent, showing the ac¬ 
cusing wounds of the official crime.The martyrs of Juchitan pass. OfVelardena, of 
Monterrey, of Acayucan, ofTopochic. Ordonez passes, Olmos y Contreras, Rivero 
Echegaray, Martinez, Valades, Martinez Carreon, Ramirez Terron, Garcia de la Ca- 
dena, Ramon Corona, Ramirez Bonilla, Albertos, Kankum, Leyva, Lugo. Legions of 
specters pass, legions of widows, legions of orphans, legions of prisoners, and the 
entire people pass, naked, gaunt, weak from ignorance and hunger. 
</p>

<p>
The Old Buzzard zealously preens the feathers disturbed by the whirl¬ 
wind of his memories, without encountering in them the reason for the revolu¬ 
tion. His conscience as a bird of prey justifies death. Are there cadavers? Life is 
thus assured. 
</p>

<p>
So live the dominating classes: on the suffering and death of the domi¬ 
nated classes; and poor and rich, the oppressed and despots, in virtue of customs 
and inherited prejudices consider this absurd state of affairs natural.

But one day a slave picks up a newspaper and reads it; it’s a libertarian 
newspaper. In it he sees how the rich abuse the poor with no more right to do so 
than force and shrewdness, in it he sees how the government abuses the people 
with no right other than force.The slave thinks then, and ends by concluding that, 
today as yesterday, force is sovereign. Force is not dominated by reason; the way 
to dominate force is with more force. 
</p>

<p>
The right to rebel penetrates into consciousness, the discontent grows, 
the dissatisfaction become insupportable, and protest breaks out in the end and 
the environment bursts into flames. One breathes an atmosphere heavy with the 
saturating odor of rebellion, and the horizon begins to clear. 
</p>

<p>
From his high perch on the rock the Old Buzzard watches. From the 
plains rumors and complaints do not rise, nor do whispers, nor cries; a roar is 
what’s heard. He lowers his gaze and shivers: he doesn’t see a single back; the 
people are on their feet. 
</p>

<p>
It’s a blessed moment when the people rise. Now it’s no longer a flock 
whose backs are toasted by the sun; now it’s no longer a sordid crowd of the 
resigned and submissive; rather it’s an army of rebels who have launched them-

<p>
selves into the conquest of the earth, and who are ennobled because they do it so 
that in the end men will walk on it. 
</p>

<p>
The right to rebel is sacred because its exercise is indispensable to 
sweeping away the obstacles blocking the right to live. Rebellion! cries the but¬ 
terfly when breaking the chrysalis that imprisons it. Rebellion! cries the chick 
when breaking through the shell that closes it in. Rebellion! cries the seedling in 
the furrow when it breaks through the earth to receive the rays of the sun. Rebel¬ 
lion! cries the human infant when it leaves its mother’s womb. Rebellion! cry the 
people when they rise up to crush tyrants and exploiters. 
</p>

<p>
Rebellion is life. Submission is death. Are there rebels among the people? 
Then life is assured, as are art, science, and industry. From Prometheus to Kropot¬ 
kin, rebels have advanced humanity. 
</p>

<p>
The supreme right of the supreme moments is rebellion. Without it, hu¬ 
manity wandered around lost even in the faint dawn of history called the stone 
age. Without it, human intelligence would have long ago run aground on the mud 
flats of dogma. Without it, the peoples would still live on their knees before princ¬ 
es and their divine right. Without it, this beautiful America would continue sleep¬ 
ing protected by the vast ocean. Without it, men would still see profiled the harsh 
outlines of the affront to humanity called the Bastille. 
</p>

<p>
And the Old Buzzard watches from his perch high on the rocks, fixing his 
bloody eye on the giant that advances without even yet understanding the reason 
for the insurrection, because tyrants simply do not understand the right to rebel.

<p>
Listen workers: very soon the infamous peace which we Mexicans have 
suffered for more than thirty years will be broken.The calm of the moment hides 
the power of tomorrow’s insurrection. Revolution is the logical consequence of 
the thousand facets that have constituted the [Diaz] dictatorship, now in its death 
agony. It must come inevitably, like clockwork, with the punctuality of the rising 
sun that dispels the darkness of night. And it is going to be you, the workers, who

<p>
are the force of this revolution. It will be your arms which take up the weapons of 
redemption. It will be your blood, like fiery red flowers, which will tint the soil of 
our nation. If some eyes will weep in mourning, in widowhood, they will be those 
of your mothers, wives, and daughters. You, then, will be the heroes. You will be 
the backbone of this thousand-headed giant called insurrection. You will be the 
strong right arm of the national will become manifest. 
</p>

<p>
The revolution must effect itself mercilessly, and what is better yet, it 
must triumph.That is, it must arrive with blood and fire even at the final feast in 
the lair of the jackals who have devoured you for the past thirty-four years. But is 
this all there is to it? Doesn’t it seem absurd to come to the point of self-sacrifice 
simply for the trifle of changing bosses? 
</p>

<p>
Workers, my friends, listen: it’s necessary, it’s urgent that you carry the 
revolution to the point where it reflects the consciousness of the epoch; it’s nec¬ 
essary, it’s urgent that it incarnates the great spiritual battle of the century If on 
the contrary, the revolution which we look on lovingly while it takes shape is 
no different than the already forgotten revolts fomented by the bourgeoisie and 
directed by the military, your role will not be that of heroic, conscious liberators, 
but simply that of cannon fodder. 
</p>

<p>
Realize it well once more: to shed blood in order to raise to power an¬ 
other bandit that oppresses the people is a crime, and this is what will happen if 
you take up arms with no objective beyond overthrowing Diaz and replacing him 
with another ruler. 
</p>

<p>
The long oppression llial ilic Mexican people have suffered and the 
hopelessness that has taken hold of everyone as a result of this oppression have 
fed a single ambition in the saddened soul of the people: a change of the men in 
government. Already those in power feel no support; the people, in the restricted 
way that they could, have hated them for so long that the fixed idea of changing 
only rulers has taken hold, and has diminished their ideals; the first saviors have 
remained subordinate to the sole desire to change the public administration. A 
sad example of this truth can be found in the crazy enthusiasm, the absurd joyous¬ 
ness greeting the candidacy of one of the most depraved functionaries, one of the 
crudest thugs in the Mexican nation: the candidacy of Bernardo Reyes. 
</p>

<p>
When his candidacy was launched, the people of Mexico didn’t reflect 
on the personality of the candidate.The people’s interest in him was simply that 
he represented change. The general hopelessness seems to have crystalized in 
these words:“anybody but Diaz,” and as Diaz is at the point of rolling into an abyss, 
the people have tied themselves to the Reyes candidacy like a hot nail [driven 
</p>


<p>

</p>




<p>
through a horseshoe]. Fortunately, even if Reyes is ambitious, at the same time 
he’s afraid to openly face Diaz and struggle against him.This cowardice has saved 
the Mexican people from suffering a cruder tyranny, a more savage oppression— 
if that were possible—than they are presently suffering. 
</p>

<p>
To avoid such lamentable dead ends, it’s necessary to reflect. The revolu¬ 
tion is imminent: neither the government nor the opposition can delay it. A body 
falls of its own weight, obeying the laws of gravity; a society in a state of revolu¬ 
tion obeys unalterable sociological rules. Attempting to oppose the outbreak of 
the revolution is a form of insanity adopted only by those who have an interest 
in seeing that the revolution does not succeed. And because the revolution must 
break out, and nothing and no one can contain it, it is good, workers, that you 
seize all of the advantages that this great movement carries within itself. If you 
are not conscious of your rights as the class that produces social wealth, you will 
be, in this great contest, simply machines that kill and destroy for the benefit of 
the bourgeoisie.This will happen if you don’t carry in your minds a clear, precise 
concept of your own emancipation and social improvement. 
</p>

<p>
Take into account, laborers, that you are the only producers of wealth. 
Houses, palaces, railways, factories, cultivated fields—everything, absolutely ev¬ 
erything is made by your creative hands, and nonetheless you lack everything. 
You weave the cloth, but you walk around almost naked; you harvest the grain, 
and you hardly have a miserable crumb to take home to your families; you build 
houses and palaces, and you inhabit huts and attics; the metals which you drag 
out of the earth only serve to make your bosses more powerful and your chains 
stronger and heavier. The more you produce the poorer and less free you be¬ 
come, for the simple reason that you make your bosses richer and freer, because 
only the rich can take advantage of political liberty. So then, if you revolt with the 
purpose of overthrowing the despotism of Porfirio Diaz, something which you 
will undoubtedly achieve, as that triumph is certain; if things go well for you after 
that victory you’ll get a government that will put in effect the Constitution of 
1857; and with that you’ll have obtained, at least in writing, your political liberty. 
But in practice you’ll be slaves every bit as much as you are today, and like today 
you’ll have only one right: that of being worked to death. 
</p>

<p>
Political liberty requires another, concurrent liberty to be effective: eco¬ 
nomic liberty. The rich enjoy this economic liberty and it’s for this reason that 
they alone benefit from political liberty. 
</p>

<p>
When the Organizing Junta of the Partido Liberal Mexicano formulated 
the program set forth in St. Louis, Missouri on July 1,1906, it had the conviction— 
</p>


<p>
CHAPTER THREE: THE REVOLUTION ★ 161 
</p>




<p>
which it still has—the very firm conviction that it guards with care, that political 
liberty must be accompanied by economic liberty if it is to be effective. For this 
reason it outlined in its program the steps that the Mexican proletariat must take 
to conquer its economic independence. 
</p>

<p>
If you don’t carry to the approaching struggle the conviction that you 
are the producers of social wealth, and because of this sole fact that you have the 
right not only to live, but to enjoy all of the material goods and all of the moral and 
intellectual benefits now enjoyed exclusively by your bosses, you will not be do¬ 
ing revolutionary work like your brothers in the more developed countries. If you 
aren’t conscious of your rights as the productive class, the bourgeoisie will take 
advantage of your sacrifice, of your blood and pain, in the same manner that today 
they take advantage of your labor, of your health, of your future, in the factories, 
fields, shops, and mines. 
</p>

<p>
So then, workers, it’s necessary that you understand that you have more 
rights than those delivered to you in the Constitution of 1857 and, above all, it’s 
necessary that you’re convinced that by the sole fact of being part of humanity 
you have the inalienable right to happiness. Happiness is not the sole patrimony 
of the bosses and owners; it’s also yours, and with better right, because you pro¬ 
duce everything that makes life pleasant and comfortable. 
</p>

<p>
All I have left to tell you is not to lose heart. I see in you the firm pur¬ 
pose of launching yourselves into the revolution in order to overthrow the most 
shameful, most hateful despotism that has ever weighed down the Mexican race: 
that of Porfirio Diaz. Your attitude merits the applause of every honorable man. 
But I repeat: carry into combat the realization that the revolution is made by your¬ 
selves, that the movement is sustained through your blood, and that the fruits of 
this struggle will be yours and your families’—if you hold firmly to the conviction 
that you have the right to enjoy all the benefits of civilization. 
</p>

<p>
Proletarians: realize that you are going to be the nerve center of the revo¬ 
lution. Go to it not like cattle going to slaughter, but like men conscious of their 
rights. Go to the struggle; strike firmly on the doors of the epoch. Glory awaits, 
impatient that you haven’t already broken your chains into pieces over the heads 
of those who oppress you.

TO THE STRIKERS AND TO THE WORKERS IN GENERAL 
</p>

<p>
Regeneracion, August 5, 1911 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
The special circumstances in which our country finds itself are excep¬ 
tionally propitious. The working class can take advantage of them and conquer 
once and for all its economic liberty. 
</p>

<p>
Capitalism and authority are crumbling in the vast expanses of our na¬ 
tional territory under the liberating blows of the Partido Liberal Mexicano. Com¬ 
merce is suspended; the factories, the workshops, the mines have closed their 
doors; in the haciendas the instruments of agriculture lie idle; railway traffic has 
fallen considerably; the panic caused by the activities of the liberals who fight 
for land and liberty have caused the export of millions of head of cattle from the 
haciendas of Madero,Trevino,Terrazas, and other brigands; the possible disobedi¬ 
ence of the soldiers of Madero who don’t surrender their arms; the division of 
the capitalist class into a multitude of parties; the rupture of the friendly rela¬ 
tions between Madero and De la Barra; the monarchism brewing in the barracks; 
the clerics showing their heads and audaciously waving the banner of reaction; 
the bosses flagellating communities to the point where they feel pushed to the 
point of taking extreme actions; the intellectual elite, filing the dagger which has 
already passed through the heart of Reyes and prods the cadaver of Madero to 
make it plunge more quickly to the depths where his dastardly ambitions have 
already sunk; the smoldering coals of hatred between the partisans of Madero and 
the federales being blown back to life by the opportunism of the bosses of both 
bands; the eagerness for power and glory of the political bosses of all types incite¬ 
ment of the passions of the masses over the illusory benefits of the electoral bal¬ 
lot; the legislatures and municipal assemblies dissolved by force when they didn’t 
lend themselves to serving a boss who offered these flocks of “representatives 
of the people” less than the previous boss; the frequent armed fights between 
Madero’s followers over questions of control; the general strike unleashed equally 
against the bosses and political tyrants; the army of unemployed filing through 
the streets and plazas of our cities; the multitudes of the hungry and malnour¬ 
ished beginning to launch hateful looks at the frightened bourgeoisie; the looting 
of stores by women, children, and old people; the peons avenging grievances by 
burning crops and killing their bosses: all of this equals chaos, the boiling up of all 
tendencies, both good and bad, of all ambitions, of all appetites. Crime and virtue,

<p>
good and bad, the great and the small, all contributing to fanning the flames which 
will result in either the disappearance of the race, if it’s incapable of regenerating 
itself by means of struggle and submits itself in cowardly fashion to its rulers, or 
the luminous regeneration of the race if it courageously pursues the struggle to 
its end: the political, social, and economic emancipation of the Mexican people. 
</p>

<p>
Mexican comrades: in these solemn moments of the history of the strug¬ 
gle of humanity for progress and perfection, millions of intelligent eyes contem¬ 
plate you from across the oceans, from other continents, from other lands, with 
the same emotion that awaits a life or death decision, because, know it well Mexi¬ 
can workers, because your triumph will be the dawn of a new day for all of the op¬ 
pressed of the Earth, just as your defeat will result in the tightening of the chains 
on every worker on Earth. 
</p>

<p>
Hundreds of strikes of a more or less revolutionary character are going 
on all over the country. Until now, the best strikes have been those of the labor¬ 
ers in the fields of Yucatan, because those comrade workers have not assumed 
the inoffensive tactic of simply walking away from their tools and crossing their 
arms expecting better wages and a shorter work week.The peons of the Yucatan 
haciendas have taken possession of many of them and are operating them them¬ 
selves, resolutely refusing the right of the rich to keep the workers as wage earn¬ 
ers. Other notable acts of reclamation of the rights of the producers have been 
the taking of the land by the inhabitants of Morelos, to work it without bosses, as 
they’ve repudiated the “right” of private property; the taking of the lands by our 
Yaqui comrades and their heroic fight against the forces of Madero, which are 
trying to dislodge them; the taking of lands by revolutionaries in various com¬ 
munities along the coast of Veracruz; the taking of the lands by some indigenous 
communities in Jalisco.The same thing is happening with other noble peoples in 
other states who have lost faith in government and who arc bringing about justice 
with their own hands. 
</p>

<p>
The revolutionary strikes have been characterized by the blowing up of 
factories with dynamite, the uprooting of plants, the caving in of mines; but it’s 
necessary to think about this. If the machinery is destroyed, little will be gained. 
It’s necessary to resolutely take possession of the factories, workshops, mines, 
foundries, etc. In place of putting down tools and crossing one’s arms, in place of 
destroying the common inheritance, comrades, revolutionary brothers, continue 
working, but under this condition: do not work for the bosses, but for yourselves 
and for your families. 
</p>


<p>
164 ★ DREAMS OF FREEDOM 
</p>




<p>
Let the factory stay standing, don’t cave in the mine, don’t pull up the 
plants; take advantage of everything. While your liberal brothers do battle with 
the hired assassins of capital and authority, continue your labors and arm your¬ 
selves, also, to defend you and yours. Don’t think that the rich have the right to ex¬ 
ploit you.This “right” is criminal, because everything that the rich have has been 
made by your hands or is a part of nature and should belong to all—the lands, the 
forests, the rivers. Work so that you don’t lack anything during this tremendous 
struggle against all oppression.The workers of the countryside will supply food 
and raw materials to the workers of the factories and workshops, and, recipro¬ 
cally, the workers of the factories and workshops will supply their brothers in the 
countryside with tools, clothing, etc.The same will happen between the mine 
workers, foundry workers, construction workers, bringing about an interchange 
of products, the distribution of which will have to freely use the railways and 
other means of transportation of raw materials or finished goods. 
</p>

<p>
Comrades: the occasion is propitious for the workers to conquer their 
economic liberty. Authority at this moment is a feather at the mercy of the winds. 
Capitalism is a throne eaten by termites to its base. Nothing else is needed to 
triumph but to repudiate the right of individual property and to give the coup de 
grace to authority. 
</p>

<p>
Hands to the work, comrades! Take immediate possession of everything 
that nature and the hands and minds of men have created. 
</p>

<p>
A strike is not redemptory. A strike is an old weapon that has lost its edge 
striking against bourgeois solidarity and the iron law of supply and demand. A 
strike is not redemptory because it recognizes the right of private property and 
accepts the right of the owner to a part of what labor produces. A strike is won, 
but the price of products goes up and the gain for the producer is perfectly illu¬ 
sory. That which before the strike cost, for example, one cent, after the strike has 
been won will cost two; and thus capital never loses and the striker never wins. 
</p>

<p>
The abolition of misery will be attained when the worker resolves not to 
recognize private property. 
</p>

<p>
Mexicans: this is the opportune moment.Take possession of everything 
that exists. Don’t pay taxes to the government; don’t pay rent for the houses you 
occupy; take the haciendas and work them in common, making use of the excel¬ 
lent machinery of the bourgeoisie; remain in and take the factories, workshops, 
mines, etc.That’s the way you’ll end misery; that’s the way you’ll achieve dignity 
in the intelligent eyes which in these solemn moments turn toward Mexico. 
</p>


<p>
CHAPTER THREE: THE REVOLUTION ★ 165

<p>
Don’t fear death: have fear of the humiliation of being slaves, of being 
beaten, of being viewed with contempt by the fat bosses who exploit you. Spit in 
the faces of those who tell you that everything can be won by peaceful means. 
Spit in the faces of those who promise to redeem you when they’re in power.To 
these: hang them!

And so, comrades, expropriate!

<p>
TO THE SOLDIERS OF CARRANZA 
</p>

<p>
Regeneration, November 6, 1915 
</p>


<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
Soldier of Carranza, listen: very soon your commander in chief will almost 
be the master of the situation; and I say “almost” because there are rebels who will 
not submit to the authority of Venustiano Carranza, but will prefer to continue on, 
gun in hand, pursuing a valuable way of life for the cause of humanity—a way of 
life that shows that surrendering arms to this government, like any other govern¬ 
ment on Earth, would be nothing other than to provide the support that capital¬ 
ism counts on in exploiting to its heart’s desire the working class, that is, to hold 
the poor perpetually under the domination of the rich. 
</p>

<p>
These rebels who continue to stand are your brothers; they’re poor like 
you and, like you, before taking up the gun their sweat watered the furrows of 
a piece of land they didn’t own.They, like you, bravely submerged themselves in 
the darkness of the mine, wringing from the rock the precious metals that would 
fill other pockets than their own.They, like you, defied anemia and tuberculosis in 
the factories at the side of those workers of iron called machines, producing cloth 
which wouldn’t cover their nakedness, shoes which would never shield their 
feet, furniture which they would never use in their shacks.They, like you, built the 
houses that provide shelter from inclement weather; they laid the rails for the rail 
line; they herded the cattle, so that they could feed on grass and stubble; they cut 
the firewood to provide heat against the cold. 
</p>

<p>
These rebels are your brothers. They also have those who await them 
in their shacks, shooting anxious looks down the dusty road—the melancholy 
mother, the sad wife, the beloved sister, the adored daughter, the ancient father, 
</p>


<p>
1 66 ★ DREAMS OF FREEDOM 
</p>




<p>
the tenderly loved children, the beloved beings who make existence magic, the 
family, in a word, without which we appear incomplete, as if something was lack¬ 
ing. 
</p>

<p>
These rebels are your brothers, only they’re more intelligent than you are; 
they don’t sacrifice themselves and they don’t sacrifice their families to elevate 
to the presidency someone who will deliver happiness to the humble, because 
experience, observation, and the teachings of history have shown that never in 
the history of humanity has this rare phenomenon existed: that a government 
concern itself with the well-being of the poor people. Totally the contrary. It has 
always been the case that the government supports the rich against the poor.You 
don’t know why this is, Carranza’s soldier, but I’ll explain it to you in a few lines. 
</p>

<p>
At first, human beings didn’t have a government; then everything be¬ 
longed to everybody; then the earth was free to be cultivated by anybody who 
wanted to do it; then the forest supplied wood and meat to anyone who wanted 
to go to the bother of going in search of these things so necessary to life; then 
the springs didn’t have an owner; then everyone had equal right to take from 
the river, the lake, or from the sea the fish they needed. In that happy time there 
was no government, because there was no private property to protect, and the 
people understood this so well that the major part of their labors were done in 
common, and the products of their labors were divided fraternally, with everyone 
taking what they needed. But then came the tribal wars, and the vanquished 
were reduced to slavery, having to work for their dominators, who, naturally, de¬ 
clared themselves owners of everything that existed. Then was born authority, 
since there were already privileges to protect: those of the victors from the van¬ 
quished. 
</p>

<p>
Here we have how the principle of authority was born—not, as is gener¬ 
ally supposed, in the need of the weak to defend themselves against the aggres¬ 
sions of the strong, but in the need of the strong to safeguard their riches against 
possible reclamations from the weak, from the dispossessed. 
</p>

<p>
If you, soldier of Carranza, don’t have material goods to lose, it’s a bad 
thing to sacrifice yourself and to sacrifice your family to elevate to the presidency 
a man who, as governor, will be your whip and your exploiter, since he will do 
nothing to your benefit, because his mission is not to protect you from the aggres¬ 
sions of the strong, but to keep you subjugated by means of the laws made by the 
strong for their own protection—not yours. 
</p>

<p>
The strong own the lands, the machinery of production, the houses, the 
means of transportation and distribution of the raw materials and manufactured 
</p>


<p>
CHAPTER THREE: THE REVOLUTION ★ 167 
</p>




<p>
products, and also the transport of persons. All this is what is called social wealth, 
and the possession of this wealth gives power to those who own it, the power 
to play at their whim with those who don’t have it. Because of this, we, the anar¬ 
chists who form the Partido Liberal Mexicano, don’t fight for increases in wages, 
nor to diminish the hours of work, nor for compensation for accidents, nor for 
pensions for the old—not for any of this, but rather for the abolition of the “right” 
of private property which makes possible the cornering of the social wealth in 
a few hands. We desire that the social wealth be the common patrimony of all of 
the inhabitants of Mexico, men and women alike, without discrimination based 
on race or color. 
</p>

<p>
All wages, high or low, compensations, pensions, and the rest, can be 
easily obtained because they don’t threaten the “right” of private property, that 
is, the right to exploit the people and to hold them in slavery. While the “right” of 
individual or private property remains, there will also remain the same evil that 
obliged you to take up arms: misery, because it will serve you nothing to increase 
your wages and to “benefit” from other reforms, such as the lowering of the hours 
of labor and all the rest, if you have to buy at a higher price that which you need 
to sustain life, to pay higher rent to the owner of the house; and that doesn’t even 
count the taxes which if the government doesn’t take them from you it’ll take 
from your bosses, who’ll then reimburse themselves by periodically raising the 
price of everything. In reality, you’ll pay the taxes, not the rich. 
</p>

<p>
See then, brother who follows Carranza, that the problem that the rebels 
are trying to resolve with arms in hand will remain when Carranza is president, 
and it’s that same problem that you have to resolve, because it affects you in the 
same manner that it affects them.Your duty is to aid them, and in order to do that 
do not giv e up your arms when you're ordered to do so when Carranza’s troops 
are discharged. What you ought to do in that moment, or sooner if possible, is to 
rebel, turning your gun upon your leaders and their officials, without trembling 
as you shoot your weapon, because they are your enemies, because they have 
an interest in the persistence of the institutions that enable them to live a life of 
privilege. A good heart, a steady pulse, and an accurate eye are all you really need, 
then, to put an end to your immediate exploiters. 
</p>

<p>
If you surrender your arm, you’ll return to your home in misery, disposed 
to sell the force of your body to whatever bourgeois for whatever he feels like 
paying you. You’ll have gained nothing, while your leaders and their officials will 
enjoy all types of pleasures in the city, savoring distinctions and ostentatiously 
displaying crosses and medals on their chests. If you remain in the army perma-

</p>





<p>
nently, soldier of Carranza, you 11 be a thug and an exploiter of your class brothers, 
because you’ll be serving to maintain the rich. 
</p>

<p>
Honor shows you the way you should take: rebellion against all govern¬ 
ment until the triumph of the principles contained in the manifesto of September 
23, 1911, issued by the organizing junta of the Partido Liberal Mexicano—prin¬ 
ciples which call for the death of capitalism, authority, and the clergy of all reli¬ 
gions. 
</p>

<p>
Decide to follow this path. Don’t be fooled by know-it-alls spouting inani¬ 
ties about needing this or that before starting such a struggle .These are the tricks 
of politicians; these are sophisms formulated and propagated by your enemies, 
even when they present themselves as being your friends. This was the argu¬ 
ment of those who opposed the great French Revolution, to impede the people 
from giving themselves political liberty; this was the argument of Porfirio Diaz, 
to impede you from giving yourselves liberties; this is the argument of the politi¬ 
cians of Carranza, to impede you from obtaining economic liberty, the basis of 
all liberties; and that is no other thing than the ability to make a living through 
working, without having to depend on anybody, an ability that can be obtained 
only—understand this well—by making the lands, the houses, the machinery, the 
means of transportation and the warehoused goods, by means of expropriation, 
the common property of all, men and women, without discrimination based on 
race or color.To those who tell you the contrary, spit in their faces and then kill 
them, because it is necessary, absolutely necessary, to initiate a severe process 
of revolutionary cleansing. We must suppress those who stand in our way, who 
stand in the way of us, the dispossessed, by any means necessary, be it good or 
bad! We must suppress them like one eliminates a tiger or a rattlesnake, as one 
crushes a tarantula.Those who tell you that you’re not prepared for any conquest 
that benefits you, they are those who have an interest in delaying your emancipa¬ 
tion in order that they might live at your expense. 
</p>

<p>
Now, soldier of Carranza, work as a man convinced that the rich and poor 
have nothing in common but the hatred they mutually profess, a hatred which 
it’s not necessary to mitigate, but rather to deepen, to exacerbate, to increase as 
much as possible. Stir up its coals so that it doesn’t die, because the existence of 
this hatred between the two social classes, the exploiters and the exploited, is 
the guarantee of struggle and the hope for emancipation of those who today find 
themselves on the lowest rung of the social ladder.

<p>
THE CARRANZA REFORMS 
</p>

<p>
Regeneration, November 25, 1915 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
Venustiano Carranza has managed to have his partisans make good on 
their promises of distribution of the land and of the endowment of communities 
with lands to be worked in common. 
</p>

<p>
Seeing that the people have no faith in promises to be fulfilled “follow¬ 
ing the triumph,” he’s making effective these promises, putting into practice the 
reforms that he added to his program when he realized that the people fight to 
acquire material goods which give them economic independence, without which 
liberty of the individual is impossible. 
</p>

<p>
In Veracruz, Yucatan, and other states controlled by Carranza, distribution 
of the lands to campesinos and the endowment of common lands to communities 
are coming to a head. But will the realization of these promises give to the dispos¬ 
sessed the liberty and well-being they have a right to as human beings? We don’t 
believe they will, because such reforms do not bring death to private or individual 
property.This iniquitous “right,” the fount of all of the evils which afflict humanity, 
remains standing, as likewise do its two powerful supports: the church and state, 
that is, the priest and authority, without which capital cannot exist. 
</p>

<p>
It wouldn’t be so bad if these distributions of land were made with the 
title gratis, that is, that there be no compensation from the beneficiaries. But that’s 
not the way it is; the campesino who receives a piece of land has to pay the value 
of that land to the rich man, by means of the government He also has to pay 
so that president of the republic, the ministers of the cabinet, the representatives, 
the senators, the judges, the employees of all kinds, the soldiers, the cops, the 
jailers, can live and can enjoy themselves . . . And that’s not even counting the 
diplomatic and consular representatives, who must be given enormous amounts 
of money because they represent the country, the thousand and one salaries and 
sinecures which are divvied up among the favorites of the government, and the 
immense quantities of money flowing through the hands of the functionaries, 
large and small, in addition to their legal wages. 
</p>

<p>
All of this must be paid, apart from the fabulous sums of money which 
are invested in the materials of war, to produce public buildings and a thousand 
other things, all of which are very costly because everyone wants to draw advan- 
</p>


<p>

</p>





<p>
tage from them, and apart, additionally, from the national debt, which climbs to 
amounts the mind cannot conceive. 
</p>

<p>
The campesino, inside this system of private or individual property, has 
to pay for the water to irrigate his parcel; he has to pay for the firewood from the 
forest or from the warehouse of the bourgeois; he has to construct his hut, which 
costs money, and he has to buy the tools and beasts necessary to his labors; he 
has to lay in provisions in order not to die of hunger awaiting his first harvest; he 
has to have funds to buy the seeds necessary to planting. In sum, he needs money 
for everything, and even for that which he doesn’t need, but which weighs upon 
him, brutalizes him, bloodies him, and exploits him: authority and the church. 
</p>

<p>
And if it’s a bad year? What grief! The government demands its taxes as if 
the harvests had been good; the usurer demands what he’s lent to the campesino, 
with no ifs ands or buts.The campesino will then have to sell or pawn his horse 
or ox, or ask for the loan of more money which will go forth and fill other stom¬ 
achs, the stomachs of our exploiters, while our children and old people languish 
in our view, victims of our stubbornness in continuing to want government, suf¬ 
fering the consequences of our lack of courage to say to the revolutionary chiefs: 
“We don’t want reforms! We want the abolition of the ‘right’ of private or individ¬ 
ual property! We want that everything should be the property of everyone! ’’And 
breaking into a thousand pieces the personal banners of the political bosses, agi¬ 
tate on high for the Manifesto of September 23,1911, the principles of which are 
the only ones that guarantee to all human beings well-being and liberty, because 
they want no more private property, nor authority, nor church. 
</p>

<p>
The poor man, the veritable pariah, the dispossessed who can’t count 
on a clod of dirt to lie his head on, he will gain nothing from the reforms of Car¬ 
ranza, because he needs money to work a piece of land. But suppose that he has 
the money for provisions, the tools of work, and everything else that is indispens¬ 
able before the first harvest. And suppose still more: that the first harvest is good 
enough. Then, the market being controlled by the capitalists, the campesino will 
have to subject himself to selling his products at very low prices to the monopo¬ 
lists, and he’ll have worked more than any day laborer for a miserable pittance, 
and misery and sadness will continue to reign in his home, while abundance and 
happiness reign in the homes of the bourgeoisie in the same manner as before 
the revolution. 
</p>

<p>
The reforms of Carranza are the bloodiest joke that the proletariat has 
ever been the butt of. Carranza’s agrarian reform is a slap in the face, delivered 
directly to the dispossessed. 
</p>


<p>
CHAPTER THREE: THE REVOLUTION * 171 
</p>




<p>
Enough of reforms! That which the hungry need is complete liberty based 
on economic independence. Down with the so-called right of private property! 
And while this iniquitous “right,” remains standing, so will the proletarians with 
arms in hand. Enough hoaxes! Proletarians: to he who speaks to you of Carranza 
and his reforms, spit in his face and smash his snout.

<p>
AT THE EDGE OF THE ABYSS 
</p>

<p>
Regeneracion, March 16, 1918 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
The bourgeoisie finds itself at the edge of an abyss, of an abyss dug deep 
by its rapacious claws, of an abyss deepened even more by its biting like an en¬ 
raged boar. 
</p>

<p>
The bourgeoisie finds itself at the edge of an abyss, of a black, profound 
abyss opened by centuries and centuries of oppression and crime. 
</p>

<p>
And the bourgeoisie slides toward that abyss on soil saturated with blood 
and tears, blood and tears that its cruelty have caused to be shed. 
</p>

<p>
There is nothing in sight to anchor it; there is not sprig of a bush to which 
it can cling; it doesn’t even have a hot branding iron to clutch to. 
</p>

<p>
The plunge is fatal: a gush of air that is like the angry breath of all suffer¬ 
ing humanity pushes it into the darkness of the abyss, of the black, profound abyss 
opened by centuries and centuries of oppression and crime. 
</p>

<p>
It is the inexorable breeze from the proletarian masses who are tired of 
the yoke, filled with bitterness, overflowing with hate. 
</p>

<p>
It is a formidable breeze from the phalanxes of misery, the sirocco of the 
dispossessed who resolve to raise their rags as a banner of redemption and retali¬ 
ation, of justice and vengeance. 
</p>

<p>
The bourgeoisie trembles beneath a sky in which all of the suns which 
bring them heat, which give them life are extinguishing; Diaz has disappeared; 
Nicholas has vanished in the darkness; Huerta has been eclipsed; Kerensky is an 
errant star that doesn’t shine; Menocal [Mario Garcia Menocal, the Cuban dicta¬ 
tor] is sinking in the mud while flinging it about; Alfonso loses his equilibrium 
and to sustain himself even for an instant makes the stupid mistake of supporting 
himself on the proletariat’s neck; Yrigoyen sinks; Guillermo, condemned by the

<p>
conscience of humanity, flaps his wings furiously in the muck, like a wounded 
vulture. 
</p>

<p>
The suns are going out! The suns are dying! 
</p>

<p>
In the overcast night, Poincare flickers like the light of a cheap lantern, 
and Edward hardly shines with the yellow light of a candle. 
</p>

<p>
This great tragedy could well have for its title “The death of the gods” or 
“The twilight of the idols.” 
</p>

<p>
And what death and what a twilight, without glory and without luster! 
</p>

<p>
Already at the edge of the abyss, the bourgeoisie wants to play its final 
card: it won’t resign itself to die; it can’t renounce its pleasures and privileges, 
drawn from the sweat and the tears of the poor, without inflicting its final gnashes 
and its final blows with its paws, claws extended. 
</p>

<p>
And the gnashing, the clawing are directed today against Russia, the 
spring from which pours intrepid currents of fertile rebellion; and tomorrow 
they’ll direct them against Mexico, the fertile land of proletarian redemption. 
</p>

<p>
The heat from this fire will enliven the timid and the strong will fill their 
lungs with an atmosphere saturated with rebellion; it will signal to the fearful 
masses that the radiance of Russia extends to the entire globe. 
</p>

<p>
The ground is ready for the new harvest: the emancipation of the 
proletariat. 
</p>

<p>
The reign of the bourgeoisie is coming to an end. 
</p>

<p>
No one has killed it; it has committed suicide! 
</p>

<p>
A merciful kick, and it will disappear into the darkness of its own 
creation.

<p>
THE MEXICAN PEOPLE ARE SUITED TO COMMUNISM 
</p>

<p>
Regeneration , September 2, 1911 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
The inhabitants of the state of Morelos, like those of Puebla, Michoacan, 
Durango,Jalisco,Yucatan and other states, in which vast areas have been invaded 
by proletarians who have immediately dedicated themselves to cultivating the 
lands, have shown the entire world, with their acts, that one doesn’t need a soci¬ 
ety of savants to solve the problem of hunger. 
</p>

<p>
To arrive at this result they took possession of the earth and the instru¬ 
ments of production in Mexico. They didn’t need “leaders,” nor “friends of the 
working class,” nor “paternal decrees,” nor “wise laws”—they didn’t need any of 
this.Their actions did it all and continue doing it all. Mexico is marching toward 
communism more quickly than the most extreme revolutionaries had hoped for, 
and the government and the bourgeoisie now find themselves not knowing what 
to do in the presence of acts they believed were very far from being carried out. 
</p>

<p>
It wasn’t even three months ago that Juan Sarabia, in a long, sickening 
open letter directed to me, which was published in the bourgeois press in Mex¬ 
ico, told me that the working class didn’t understand what we are advocating 
and that the people were satisfied with the fruits of Madero’s revolt: the electoral 
ballot. But facts have shown that we members of the PLM are not under illusions, 
and that we fight convinced that our actions and propaganda respond to the ne¬ 
cessities and to the manner of thinking of Mexico’s poor. 
</p>

<p>
The Mexican people hate, by instinct, authority and the bourgeoisie. Ev 
eryone who has lived in Mexico can assure us that there is no one more cordially 
hated than the policeman, that the word “government” fills the simple people 
with uneasiness, that the soldier, admired and applauded in all other places, is 
seen with antipathy and contempt, and that anyone who doesn’t make his living 
with his hands is hated. 
</p>

<p>
This in itself is enough for a social revolution which is economic in na¬ 
ture and anti-authoritarian, but there is more. Four million Indians live in Mexico 
who, until twenty or twenty-five years ago, lived in communities possessing the 
lands, the waters, and the forests in common. Mutual aid was the rule in these 
communities, in which authority was felt only when the tax collector appeared 
periodically or when “recruiters” showed up in search of men to force into the 
army. In these communities there were no judges, mayors, jailers, in fact no both- 
</p>


<p>
176 ★ DREAMS OF FREEDOM 
</p>




<p>
ersome people at all of this type. Everyone had the right to the land, to the water 
to irrigate it, to the forests for firewood, and to the wood from the forests for the 
construction of small houses. The plows passed from hand to hand, as did yokes 
of oxen. Each family worked as much land as they thought was sufficient to pro¬ 
duce what was necessary, and the work of weeding and harvesting was done in 
common by the entire community—today, Pedro’s harvest, tomorrow Juan’s, and 
so on. Everyone in the community put their hands to the work when a house was 
to be raised. 
</p>

<p>
These simple customs lasted until authority grew strong enough to pac¬ 
ify the country, until it was strong enough to guarantee the bourgeoisie the suc¬ 
cess of its businesses.The generals of the political revolts received large grants of 
land; the hacendados [plantation owners] increased the size of their fieMoms; 
the most vile politicians received vast tracts of “barren” lands; and foreign adven¬ 
turers obtained concessions of lands, forests, rivers, of, in sum, everything, leaving 
our Indian brothers without a clod of dirt, without the right to take from the for¬ 
ests even the smallest branch of a tree; they were left in the most abject misery, 
dispossessed of everything that had been theirs. 
</p>

<p>
As regards the mestizo population [of mixed Indian and Spanish heri¬ 
tage] , which is the majority of the people of Mexico—with the exception of those 
who inhabited the great cities and large towns—they held the forests, lands, and 
bodies of water in common, just as the indigenous peoples did. Mutual aid was 
also the rule; they built their houses together; money was almost unnecessary, 
because they bartered what they made or grew. But with the coming of peace 
authority grew, and the political and financial bandits shamelessly stole the lands, 
forests, and bodies of water; they stole everything. Not even twenty years ago one 
could see in opposition newspapers that the North American X, the German Y, 
or the Spaniard Z had enveloped an entire population within the limits of “his” 
property, with the aid of the Mexican authorities. 
</p>

<p>
We see, then, that the Mexican people are suited for communism, be¬ 
cause they’ve practiced it, at least in part, for many centuries; and this explains 
why, even when the majority are illiterate, they comprehend that rather than 
take part in electoral farces that elect thugs, it’s better to take possession of the 
lands—and this taking is what scandalizes the thieving bourgeoisie. 
</p>

<p>
All that’s left to be done is that the workers take possession of the fac¬ 
tory, the workshop, the mine, the foundry, the railroad, the ship, in a word, every¬ 
thing—that they recognize no bosses of any type. And this will be the culmina¬ 
tion of the present movement. 
</p>

<p>
Forward comrades!

EXPROPRIATE!

<p>
Regeneration, February 10, 1912 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
We know that agents of Emilio Vazquez Gomez, the new pretender to 
the presidential seat, are putting into play the same swindles used by Francisco I. 
Madero to attract our partisans to his files. The agents of Vazquez Gomez assure 
our partisans, in private, naturally, that we are in accord with their “chief” in over¬ 
throwing Madero This is a lie. We work independently of Vazquez Gomez because 
our object is not the achievement of power.We don’t want to get rid of one bandit 
to elevate another—and everyone who comes to power necessarily becomes a 
bandit. 
</p>

<p>
Emilio Vazquez Gomez is a lawyer, that is, he belongs to the bourgeoisie, 
and as one of them he must serve the bourgeoisie. He does not approve of the 
expropriation of the lands by means of violence. Vazquez wants Madero to fall, 
to assume his seat in the presidential palace, and then he will dictate laws which 
resolve the social problem. Madero said the same thing. Don’t forget it! 
</p>

<p>
That which the proletarians can obtain in the midst of revolutionary fer¬ 
ment cannot be obtained later. When peace comes, authority will become strong, 
and as it necessarily must fulfill its mission, which is none other than to defend the 
interests of the capitalist class, the Mexican proletariat will remain in the same or 
worse conditions as before. 
</p>

<p>
More than thirty thousand Mexicans have lost their lives in the course 
of this revolutionary movement, and the blood spilled and the blood that will be 
spilled in what follows cannot serve—we cannot permit it to serve—to elevate a 
few bandits to power.To arms!—but to snatch the earth and the means of produc¬ 
tion from the hands of the bourgeoisie, leaving everything in the power of the 
workers! 
</p>

<p>
Our manifesto of September 23, 1911 clearly expressed the goals of the 
Partido Liberal Mexicano. Convinced by experience and the lessons of history 
that political liberties do not guarantee the right to life, we invite all Mexicans 
to back our goals of conquering this primary right, without which humanity will 
never be free. What good to a human being is the right to vote, to think, to write 
about whatever matter, to meet, to go from one place to another, etc., if to eat he

needs to rent his arms to the rich for a miserable wage, and then is fortunate to 
find someone to exploit him? 
</p>

<p>
War against the wage system, Mexicans! To end this system there’s only 
one way: to make the lands and the machinery of production for common use; 
and this can be achieved only through means of force, since if one waits for 
the government to decree expropriation, millions and millions of years will pass 
without this phenomenon ever coming into being. 
</p>

<p>
So then workers, expropriate! Whatever the banner you militate under: 
expropriate and everything will become the property of all. And if those who di¬ 
rect the operations of war oppose this work of supreme social justice, kill them! 
</p>

<p>
Whoever it may be, with arms in hand, that tells you that you’ll obtain 
this or that improvement after the triumph is a swindler: execute him! You would 
have saved yourselves so much fatigue, so much blood, so many tears, so much 
despair, if you would only have listened to our words when we told you to turn 
your guns on your leaders and officials last year! Well then, let this painful experi¬ 
ence benefit you this time. Don’t serve as cannon fodder so that your chiefs and 
officials can adorn themselves with gold and feathers. Don’t elevate anyone to the 
presidency of the republic, because the pay you’ll receive for your sacrifices will 
be, once you’ve elevated new exploiters, that you’ll be commanded to return to 
your homes, to begin again that same life of privations and humiliations, because 
nothing will be changed then; the capitalist system will continue to oppress you, 
and with more cruelty, because the rich will be anxious to recoup the losses 
suffered during the revolution, and you’ll be the ones paying for all the broken 
glass.

Miserable, unfortunate brothers: Now or never! Expropriate!

<p>
THE CHAINS OF “THE FREE” 
</p>

<p>
Regeneracion, October 22, 1910 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
Upon reading the constitutions of the advanced countries of the world, 
the philosopher can’t do anything other than smile.The citizen, according to these 
constitutions, is an almost all-powerful being, free, sovereign, the boss and owner 
of presidents and kings, of ministers and generals, of judges, magistrates, represen¬ 
tatives, senators, mayors, and a swarm of great and small functionaries. And the 
citizen, with an innocence that experience hasn’t destroyed, believes himself free 
&#x2026; because the law says so. 
</p>

<p>
“Within our national territory everyone is born free,” says our constitu¬ 
tion. Free! And with the eyes of our imagination we see the peon bent over the 
furrow; he leaves his bed before the sun comes up; he returns to it late after night 
has fallen. Free! And in the black, loathsome, deafening factory, swarms a multi¬ 
tude of sweaty, panting, prematurely aged men who should be in their full vigor. 
Free! And everywhere we see men and women, old and young, work without rest 
in »rder to lift to their mouths a piece of bread—a piece of bread which is noth¬ 
ing more than is strictly necessary for the worker to continue his labors. Was it 
perhaps totally different when slavery was maintained under the law? Does the 
man of today, the “citizen,” work less, even, than when he was a slave? 
</p>

<p>
The slave was happier than the free worker today As the slave cost the 
owner money, the owner was careful with the slave; he had him work in mod¬ 
eration, he fed him well, he sheltered him when it was cold, and if he fell ill, he 
entrusted him to the care of doctors. Today the great bosses don’t give a damn 
about their workers. It doesn’t cost them money to acquire them and they have 
their workers undertake exhausting tasks which in a few years cost them their 
health.They don’t care that the workers’ families will lack food and other neces¬ 
sities, because the slaves and their families do not belong to them. 
</p>

<p>
The worker of today is as much a slave as the chattel slave was yesterday, 
with the only difference being that the worker can choose his boss. But he pays 
highly for this privilege in that he doesn’t enjoy the conveniences, attention, and 
care of which the slave of old and his family were objects. But if one must lament 
the situation of the modern worker, that’s no reason to sigh longingly for the days 
when slavery was legal. We should instead search for the most appropriate means 
of destroying the present system, because experience shows us that the work- 
</p>


<p>
182 ★ DREAMS OF FREEDOM 
</p>




<p>
er of today, who carries the pompous title “citizen,” is a true slave upon whom 
weighs the authority of the boss.The worker also has to support upon his weak 
back all of the social and political weight, the burden of which has been cleverly 
shifted from the rich and illustrious to fall with crushing weight exclusively upon 
the backs of the proletariat. 
</p>

<p>
Capital, according to political economics, is accumulated work. The ma¬ 
chinery, buildings, docks, railways are accumulated labor, that is, the work of intel¬ 
lectual and manual laborers in all of the ages up to the present day, and, therefore, 
there’s no reason that this work should belong to a few individuals. Capital, in 
effect, is simply the laborious work of generations who contributed their science, 
art, or simply their manual labor to form it. Modern machinery is no more than 
the perfection brought to a head by generations of inventors, workers, artisans, 
each one of whom played his part in producing the complicated mechanisms 
that we admire today, and that should be the property of all, because they are the 
result of a collective work; but they belong—so declares the law, the law made by 
the rich—to only a few individuals. 
</p>

<p>
If capital is the work of generations of laboring human beings, as is indis¬ 
putable, it can’t belong to a small number of individuals, but rather it belongs to 
everyone who is disposed to follow the path of members of previous generations 
who exerted themselves in increasing the amount of capital with their individual 
work. This is what logic and justice counsels; but the law, to which logic and 
justice are bothersome obstacles, orders the contrary. It’s because of this that the 
proletariat must put itself at the orders of a boss to be able to live, permitting that 
the product of its labors pass almost entirely into the pockets of those who hold 
the social wealth. 
</p>

<p>
All rights are guaranteed, except the right to live. The right to live is the 
basis of all rights, and consists of the right that all human beings have to take 
full advantage, simply by the fact of being alive, of all that exists, with no other 
obligation than that of allowing all other human beings to do the same, with all 
dedicated to the conservation and increase of the social wealth. 
</p>

<p>
Understand, proletarians, that you have the right to something more than 
the handout that you are given for your labor under the name of “wages.” You 
have the right to receive the full product of your labor, because capital belongs 
to all, men and women, old and young. A wage, therefore, is an outrage: it’s the 
chain of the “free”—the chain that it’s necessary to break in order that the word 
“citizen” ceases to be an affront, that it ceases to describe slaves. If this is done, 
we’ll have achieved economic liberty. 
</p>


<p>
CHAPTER FIVE: CLASS WAR ★ 183 
</p>




<p>
The task, however, is not easy. Not only are the law and its upholders—the 
priest, the soldier, the cop, the judge, and all the machinery of government—op¬ 
posed to this beautiful ideal, but also the passivity of the multitudes, the inaction 
of the masses accustomed to servitude and outrages to the point of finding them 
absolutely natural, a normal order: that the poor be a beast of burden for the rich 
and that the government be an abusive stepfather empowered by god to punish 
the people. It’s necessary that the masses think differently, that they comprehend 
their rights so that they are inclined to reclaim them; and the principal right is the 
right to live. 
</p>

<p>
This requires an arduous amount of education, and going to the pub¬ 
lic schools isn’t adequate to attain it. The public schools educate the people in 
the sense of making every man a supporter of the present system. If the people 
learned in the public schools not to recognize the “right’’ of the capitalists to ap¬ 
propriate the product of the work of the proletariat, the United States, for exam¬ 
ple, would already have taken a pace on the road to economic liberty, since almost 
all North Americans know how to read and write. But in the schools they teach 
totally the contrary: they teach the child to admire the dexterity with which some 
men take advantage of the sweat and the exhausting work of others, in order to 
make themselves into kings of steel, oil, and other things. In the school the child 
is taught that saving and hard work are the origin of these modern Midases who 
leave the imbeciles gaping, when experience shows that only evil deeds, violence, 
and crime can bring wealth to a man. 
</p>

<p>
The people then need education, but not the education of the public 
schools, whose programs have been suggested or dictated by those with an inter¬ 
est in perpetuating the slavery of the poor for the benefit of the evil and brazen, 
i iiC CuUCtlliuii Lif LiiC masses, in order to be truly in tiicif interests and m line with 
the advancements in human understanding, must be in the charge of the workers, 
that is, those who pay the costs should suggest the educational program.This will 
ensure that young proletarians will enter fully into life, well armed with the mod¬ 
ern ideas which will blow upon humanity the healthy breath of social justice. 
</p>

<p>
At the side of proletarian education there should also be a workers’ union; 
and so, with the joining of the union of the exploited and education, we will man¬ 
age to break forever the evil chain which make slaves of the poor and bosses of 
the rich: the wage system.When we break it, all of humanity will freely and intel¬

But before the Mexican proletariat can unite and educate itself, it is nec¬ 
essary that there be at least some material well-being. The long hours of labor, 
the insufficient food, the hard conditions in the places of labor and habitation, 
make it so that the Mexican laborer cannot progress. Tired from long hours of 
work, he hardly has enough time to rest before he must return to his prisoner-like 
task. And of course this doesn’t allow time to meet with his comrades from work 
and discuss and think over the common problems of the proletariat, nor does this 
allow him time to open a book or read a workers’ newspaper.The laborer, thus, is 
absolutely at the mercy of voracious capitalism.Therefore it’s necessary to reduce 
the hours of work and to increase wages at the same time as land is delivered to 
the poor. In this way we can create an environment propitious for the education 
and the unity of the working class. 
</p>

<p>
But in order to do this we must resort to violence. Opposed to the in¬ 
terests of the dispossessed are the interests of the rich and the interests of the 
bandits who are in power. Those who possess wealth are not going to allow the 
people a respite to catch their breaths and enter fully into the great struggle 
against those who oppose the emancipation of humanity.There remains no other 
recourse for the disinherited than to resort to force of arms to form, through our 
own efforts, a better environment in which we can educate ourselves and unite 
firmly for the great conquests that are to come. 
</p>

<p>
Education and solidarity, having as their base the alleviation of present 
conditions, will be the immediate fruit of the coming revolution. A step beyond 
this and we’ll have arrived in the shadows of the ideal.

<p>
Welcome the revolution. Welcome this sign of life, this sign of vigor in a 
people who are at the edge of the grave.

demand your attention.Your woman suffers, almost always in silence.These are 
the consequences of your docility toward those who scourge you.

<p>
You are to blame that your children are hungry; upon your conscience 
hangs the pain and misfortune of your family. 
</p>

<p>
Yes, you are culpable because you have contempt for your own class and 
admire, follow, applaud, and cheer the rich, those who shine with the gold that 
you have amassed with your sweat. It’s in this manner that you yourself forge the 
chains that make you a slave. 
</p>

<p>
Rebel, proletarian; but rebel with those of your own class, with those 
who, like you, have their hands callused and their backs curved by hard labor. 
Moreover, don’t rebel in any manner whatsoever. Don’t be a blind force, but a 
conscious force; that is, attack, burn, overthrow, destroy, spread death; but carry in 
your mind the idea that you fight for your class, that you’re going to emancipate 
your class, that you’re going to destroy the right of private property so that the 
riches of the earth cannot continue to be the exclusive patrimony of the rich and 
the intellectuals, that is, of knowledgeable men. 
</p>

<p>
Join the files of the Partido Liberal Mexicano. Refuse indignantly those 
who try to tell you to follow Madero, because, hear this well: Madero is your 
exploiter; he is the exploiter of your class. Madero is rich and doesn’t think of 
anything other than increasing his wealth.Yesterday he made millions exploiting 
your brothers on his haciendas. Now he wants to make more millions with the 
blood of the humble. 
</p>

<p>
Awake proletarian: call your shame to your aid.You don’t feel humiliated 
before the haughtiness of the rich? They rob you of the product of your labor and 
scoff at your dirtiness and rags. For the rich you aren't the creator of the wealth 
and luxury that they enjoy, but simply a bum. You make their palaces, and if you 
dare to go to those palaces they call a cop to take you to jail.You raise the crops, 
but be caref ul about taking them from lire warehouses because you could die of a 
gun shot or end up in jail.You make the rich fabric and the comfortable furniture 
and carpets that aren’t for your woman or for your children. You make every¬ 
thing that makes life agreeable, you keep the parks well tended, you construct 
and maintain the streets and highways, you tend the rails, you make the houses 
that you have to pay to live in. In sum, you make everything; everything flows 
from your creative hands. And nonetheless you don’t get anything for it beyond 
that which is strictly necessary for you to continue to create more riches, riches, 
riches—and for that you get the contempt of those who exploit you, since to 
them you’re nothing but a bum, an inferior being belonging to the lesser people, 
to the rabble.

As he’s no longer in contact with the people, he doesn’t see in it anything 
other than a flock that it’s necessary to whip, a herd that it’s necessary to force 
to march along the beaten path, something which he formerly combated with all 
his strength and energy. His new friends will appear better, given that they supply 
to him many more pleasures and refinements which make life comfortable and 
sweet.

<p>
History does not register in its pages the name of a single ruler who was 
seriously concerned with saving the people from misery and tyranny, and the his¬ 
tory of humanity already goes back thousands of years.Through it, we know that 
the ruler, the rich man, and the priest of whatever religion have been inseparable 
allies, conniving together throughout the ages to keep the people in slavery.

Let us not fall under the illusion, Mexicans, that a grizzled, bearded man is 
better suited to govern us than a fresh-faced youth. Neither is goodIThe best thing 
is not to have anyone on our shoulders; the best thing is to be our own guides; the 
best thing is to think and to resolve our own affairs with our own heads.

If you trust that Carranza will make you free and happy, I don’t know 
what to think of you, proletarians, because this would indicate that experience 
and the lessons of history have not been able to destroy the vice injected into you 
by your oppressors, and that vice consists of believing that a man can only live 
beneath the yoke of another. Understand, brothers in chains, that the principle of 
authority lives in the minds of the humble; those who have indoctrinated you in 
this error have been your oppressors. 
</p>

<p>
The deciding moment is at hand. Huerta is high tailing it toward other 
countries and a new ambitious one prepares to take his place. If you want to have 
more governments, submit yourselves; and with your submission the true revolu¬ 
tion—that which wants to clear from the table all tyrants and exploiters—will 
die, crushed by your indifference. But if, on the contrary, you labor like true work¬ 
ers, like men who know that the social wealth has been made by yourselves and, 
therefore, only you yourselves have the right to enjoy it, then rise up to support 
your brothers who continue with arms in hand; then you’ll merit the applause 
of all of the intelligent men of the world and you’ll be able to say with pride: “In 
Mexico the institution called authority is a thing of the past, because there you’ll 
find men.”

ALL RULERS ARE THE SAME 
</p>

<p>
Regeneration, July 25 , 1914 
</p>


<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
A man can have good intentions prior to being a ruler, but it’s very dif¬ 
ficult for him to conserve those intentions upon reaching power, and it’s impos¬ 
sible that he’ll still have them when he’s a ruler. 
</p>

<p>
To reach power it’s necessary that the candidate enter into compromises 
with the enemies of his party so as to assure his election, offering those enemies 
benefits that can only be delivered through sacrificing his ideals. He arrives then 
in power, without anything left of his desires favoring the people, and disposed 
simply to do everything he can to assure his remaining in the coveted position. 
</p>

<p>
If, by mere chance, the man has been able to elevate himself without enter¬ 
ing into compromises with his enemies, and, therefore, conserves intact the inten¬ 
tions he had when promising to pursue the good of the people, these intentions 
will die in his breast one by one before he begins to put them into practice. As 
soon as he’s in power he’ll see himself surrounded by individuals who are pow¬ 
erful by virtue of their wealth, their influence, their talent, their knowledge, and 
by astute politicians who know how to contrive to be in the good graces of the 
government, men who get up with the rising sun disposed to change their stripes 
with each day if it’s necessary to the pursuit of their selfish ends 
</p>

<p>
In such an environment, the man who previously rubbed elbows with 
the common people will forget them. Sickened by the incense of adulators, re¬ 
galed by distinguished men and women of high rank, in continuous contact with 
diplomats and other gilded insects of international politics, he’ll come to believe 
that he is better than other men, and he’ll feel himself superior or make himself 
into a tyrant like any other ruler. 
</p>

<p>
The projects that he had in his head about freeing the people from tyr¬ 
anny will make him laugh; he’ll consider them unrealizable, criminal attacks on 
acquired rights, monstrous crimes. It’s simply that a new manner of looking at 
things will unfold within him. Before, he saw things from the bottom looking up; 
now he sees things from the top looking down. His psychology is different: before, 
he thought and felt as a part of the great mass that comprises the nation; now, he 
feels detached from this great mass, he sees himself about this mass, he believes 
himself better than the mass, he imagines himself superior to the mass.

healthy education that, according to the noble dreams of its author, would inevi¬ 
tably make humanity better, freer, happier. 
</p>

<p>
I have here demonstrated, comrades, the impossibility of resolving the 
social problem through peaceful means. Capital, Authority, and the Clergy, with 
all the influence they have, with all the forces at their disposal, are determined 
to defend their interests and to drown in blood even the most peaceful activities 
involving what we love and what we’re forced to do to bring about the advent of 
liberty, equality, and fraternity. 
</p>

<p>
The work of Ferrer was being conducted in a perfectly legal manner; it 
didn’t go a step beyond the guarantees in the political constitutions which have 
cost the people so much blood; he didn’t advocate violence as a means of reach¬ 
ing the desired communist system, and nonetheless the bloodied cadaver of the 
teacher proclaims to the world that political liberty is a vile lie, that by taking the 
peaceful way one will surely arrive at martyrdom, but not victory, which is what 
the disinherited need. 
</p>

<p>
The Mexican people do not deny the excellence of a rationalist educa¬ 
tion. But we understand, through the lessons of history, that to struggle against 
force with no other arm than reason is to retard the arrival of the free society 
for thousands and thousands of years, during which exploitation and tyranny 
will have ended up converting the proletariat into a separate species, incapable 
through heredity of rebelling and crushing the bourgeoisie, tyrants, and monks 
with their fists. 
</p>

<p>
The privileged classes will never permit that the proletariat open its 
eyes, because this would signify the thundering downfall of their empire, which 
is sustained as much through force of arms as it is through the ignorance of the 
dispossessed. 
</p>

<p>
Comrades: Let the death of the teacher serve to convince the pacifists 
that in order to put an end to social inequality, to kill off privilege, to make every 
human being a free person, it’s necessary to use force and to rip, through its use, 
the riches from the bourgeoisie who interpose themselves between the human 
being and liberty. 
</p>

<p>
The revolution that the Partido Liberal Mexicano is fomenting is based 
on the realization that reason without force is a weak reed at the mercy of the 
repressions unleashed by the forces of infuriated reaction, and that because of 
this the Mexican libertarians will not surrender; because of this they struggle 
without respite; because of this, audacious and gallant, they stand waving the red 
banner of proletarian redemption, while the idol worshipers wait for the despots 
to throw them a crumb, without thinking—idiots!—that they have the right to 
take everything.

see those below, while in the barrios, thousands and thousands of human beings 
smothered in the infernal heat of their garrets for the simple crime of working 
and sweating so that the good-for-nothings in the procession could make a waste¬ 
ful show of their gold and silks. 
</p>

<p>
Military bands filled the air with heroic harmonies; the fortunate mem¬ 
bers of the bourgeoisie laughed; the soldiers, with blows, made the crowd re¬ 
treat; the streets shone with patriotic adornments.The king and the queen formed 
part of that parade of the greatest leaches in Spain. Flowers rained down from 
the roofs and balconies. From the hands of one man, from a roof, came a pretty 
wreath, whose flowers smiled in the sun. This wreath exploded. It was a bomb 
adorned with flowers! The man who had thrown it was a friend of Ferrer, Mateo 
Moral.The monster of clericalism shivered with satisfaction. “Now we have him!” 
cried the clergy. And while Mateo watered the earth with his blood, the earth that 
he dreamed of seeing peopled by a free humanity, in Barcelona the hands of the 
police grabbed the noble founder of the Modern School. 
</p>

<p>
The trial was long.They resorted to every device they had to convict that 
innocent man, until, after he spent a year and a half in prison, the government put 
him at liberty. The clerical beast returned to its scheming, spying on the move¬ 
ment of that extraordinary man, until a new opportunity presented itself. 
</p>

<p>
Spain was at war with the Moors in mid-1909-The conscious workers 
were opposed, naturally, to this stupid shedding of proletarian blood to defend the 
interests of a few mine owners in North Africa.The government, defender of capi¬ 
tal, sent soldiers and more soldiers to the battlefield. Demonstrations against this 
criminal war spread throughout Spain. In Barcelona, a general strike was called 
against the sending of more soldiers to fight for the interests of their oppressors. 
Clashes between the police and the strikers commenced, and there was a general 
insurrection in the city. Groups of revolutionaries set fire to the churches and 
convents, and battled like lions in the streets of the great city until, due to the 
arrival of troops in great numbers, they had to hide their arms awaiting a better 
opportunity. 
</p>

<p>
Then the persecutions commenced, having Ferrer as the target, even 
though Ferrer, as was well demonstrated, had taken no part in the insurrection. Ar¬ 
rested, he was tried by judges who had orders to sentence him to death, and de¬ 
spite having clearly shown his innocence, he was shot on October 13,1909 in the 
Montjuich fort.

That martyr of the proletariat, whose exemplary life of abnegation and 
sacrifice has awoken in so many noble proletarian hearts the desire to follow in 
his footsteps, often said to me:“To be alive is to be a prisoner.’T refer to the young 
martyr of Janos, Praxedis G. Guerrero, the first Mexican libertarian who had the 
audacity to emit for the first time in Mexico the sublime cry: Land and Liberty!

<p>
The world is a prison, a much larger one than those with which we’re 
familiar, but a prison nonetheless. The prison guards are the police and soldiers; 
the wardens are the presidents, kings, and emperors; the watchdogs are the legis¬ 
lators; and in this sense we can exactly equate the armies of prison functionaries 
and their acts with the armies of government functionaries and their acts. The 
downtrodden, the plebeians, the disinherited masses are the prisoners, obliged to 
work to support the army of functionaries and the lazy, thieving rich. 
</p>

<p>
To free humanity from everything that contributes to making this beauti¬ 
ful Earth a vale of tears is a task for heroes, and this was what motivated Francisco 
Ferrer Guardia. As his means, he chose the education of young children, and he 
founded the Modern School, from which would come beings emancipated from 
prejudices of all types, men and women suited for reasoning and for understand¬ 
ing nature, life, and social relations. In the Modern School, the child was stimu¬ 
lated to have the habits of investigation and reasoning, so that he wouldn’t blindly 
accept religious, political, social, and moral dogmas with which children’s heads 
are stuffed in the official schools. It was the aim that the child arrive at under¬ 
standing, through his own efforts, the natural history of the Earth and universe, 
the appearance and evolution of life, natural history as a whole, and the formation 
and development of human societies throughout the ages, up to our days. 
</p>

<p>
The Spanish clergy viewed with disgust this type of education which 
would counteract their efforts to perpetuate prejudices, traditions, and atavisms; 
the Spanish clergy today is the same clergy as in the time of Loyola and the Inqui¬ 
sition. For these clerics, fomenters of fanaticism which makes possible resigna¬ 
tion in the face of capitalist tyranny and exploitation, the work of Ferrer was an 
affront and, making the sign of the cross, they decreed in the shadows, like the 
cowards they are, the death of Ferrer’s work and its author. 
</p>

<p>
Their opportunity didn’t delay in presenting itself. One pretty day a flashy 
procession passed through the streets of Madrid in celebration of the marriage of 
Alfonso XIII with Enna de Batenberg. All was silks, perfumes, colors, the shine of 
gold, luxury—an extravagance of riches in that brilliant procession. The aristoc¬ 
racy of money and parchment used that day to ostentatiously show their power, 
influence, insulting opulence, and the haughty disdain with which those on top

Patriotism is a dish seasoned exclusively for the consumption of the poor. 
We’re informed that the invasion is an affront and that we ought to resist it. Did 
Carranza resist it? He didn’t resist it because it benefitted the social class which 
every government must support: the capitalist class. 
</p>

<p>
Now, deprived of the hope that American bayonets will keep him in pow¬ 
er, Carranza is throwing himself into the arms of Germany. In a note which he’s 
sent to the neutral nations, Carranza invites these nations to suspend commerce 
with the belligerent nations, arguing that in this manner they will be left isolated 
and will see themselves forced, in the end, to agree to peace in view of not being 
able to count on provisions from the outside. 
</p>

<p>
The Central Powers will be the beneficiaries if this project of Carranza 
is put into practice, because England will receive a mortal blow impeding it from 
obtaining from the petroleum-producing area of Tampico the oil it needs to keep 
its fleet in motion, and England will have to adopt extreme measures to keep its 
supply lines open. What will happen? England will send soldiers to occupy the 
Tampico region. 
</p>

<p>
It’s patently obvious that patriotism isn’t practiced by those who incul¬ 
cate it into others. It’s a sentiment that’s infused in us so that we ll put ourselves 
at the disposition of our exploiters. When we take the gun in hand to defend the 
nation, that which we re defending is the property of our bosses. Let us open our

Capital, Authority, Clergy: This is the hydra which guards the gates of 
this prison called Earth.The human being, so prideful, so boastful, so self-satisfied 
about his supposed liberties—what else is he other than a galley slave, a shackled

get away with it, to his own interest and against the interests of the rest.

fortunes we’ve been subjected to in our place on the lowest rungs of the social 
ladder; despite everything we find ourselves disposed to commit the worst ex¬ 
cesses, to kill and allow ourselves to be killed for the nation, for this thing which 
for its part provides us no benefit and in exchange demands of us the greatest 
sacrifices. 
</p>

<p>
It’s necessary to confess that all of the demands implied in patriotism fall 
exclusively on the shoulders of the poor.The poor man knows only that he has 
a country because he has to serve in the army, and the benefits he receives from 
the country are the clubbing by the cop, the taxes to pay the government’s costs, 
his unpaid nightly rounds, the “fatiga” [provision of unpaid services], and the law 
which subjects him to eternal servitude beneath the claws of the owners of the 
lands and machinery. 
</p>

<p>
To the poor man, the country provides no benefit because it’s not his. 
The country is the property of the few who are the owners of the lands, the 
mines, the houses, the factories, the railroads—of everything that exists; but the 
poor man is indoctrinated from childhood to love the country so that he’ll pick 
up a gun in defense of interests that aren’t his when his bosses realize that their 
interests are in danger and send out a patriotic call to the masses. It’s so certain 
that material interests are at the heart of the country that the bourgeoisie will not 
oppose a foreign invasion when its aim is not to despoil them of their properties, 
and they’ll even welcome it when the foreign bayonets can lend some support 
to the principle of private property and this principle is in danger of falling to 
pieces under the furious assaults of popular justice. 
</p>

<p>
The two invasions that Mexico has suffered during the course of the 
revolution have had no other object than to suffocate the revolutionary move¬ 
ment that threatens the stability of the principle of private property.The two U.S. 
invasions were carried out to place Venustiano Carranza in the presidential seat 
and to consolidate a strong government capable of making the law respected, 
that is, capable of being the shield of the strong, their defense against the possible 
attacks of those who possess nothing. 
</p>

<p>
The Mexican bourgeoisie haven’t protested these two invasions, because 
they were intended to save their properties which were threatened by the virile 
attitude of Mexicans eager to gain their economic liberty. If it hadn’t been that the 
American workers protested against this invasion and refused to join the army to 
go put Carranza in the presidential seat, there would have been long months in 
which this acting president would have had the shelter of strong contingents of 
U.S. soldiers.

Regeneracion, February 24, 1917 
</p>


<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
We poor people are incited in a thousand ways to be patriots. From the 
time we’re born until we exhale our last breath, these words buzz in our ears: 
“Love your country, love your country, love your country” 
</p>

<p>
It could be said that we suck in patriotism with the first drops of milk 
from the breasts of our mothers. The mother lulls us to sleep with songs that 
glorify the nation. Later, we’re taught to love the flag, whose colors appear more 
brilliant to us than those of any other flag. As children, we’re overwhelmed with 
playthings that make us play at being soldiers: drums, wooden swords, flags, clay 
or lead soldiers, and, stuffed full of the legends which extol the exploits of the 
nation’s heroes, we pretend in our games to be on battlefields where we would 
make all those who had committed the crime of being born outside the nation’s 
boundaries bite the dust, because every good patriot is the enemy of those who 
aren’t born inside his country’s borders. 
</p>

<p>
Patriotic education doesn’t end with childhood games: it continues in 
grammar school.There, the good teacher makes us intone choruses in which we 
exalt the country; in our reading book we spell out compositions in prose and 
verse in honor of the country, and our eyes fill with wonder before the illustra¬ 
tions representing acts of war, with each one of us wanting to be the happy Sag 
bearer who has the great honor of holding aloft his country’s banner in the midst 
of the butchery. We hear the national anthem, and our blood stirs faster in our 
veins. 
</p>

<p>
The priest, in his sermons, exhorts us to love the nation; the politician, 
in his speeches, speaks to us about the greatness of the country; the bourgeois 
periodical stimulates our patriotic sentiments; wherever we turn our gaze we find 
a statue of a patriot or a drawing with a patriotic theme; patriotic holidays, besides 
being numerous, have an air of great solemnity. Everything, in the end, is carefully 
calculated to light, and to keep lit, the patriotic fire in our breasts. 
</p>

<p>
Prepared in this manner, and even when we don’t own a clod of earth to 
recline our heads on; even when we don’t possess a square inch of the country 
we’ve been taught to love;despite all the indignities,humiliations, abuses, and mis-

for a government. The lands, the forests, the waters, and the fields have been, 
until recently, the common property of the inhabitants of the regions. When one 
speaks about government to these simple people, they begin trembling with fear, 
because the government, for them, has been the same as a tormenter: it means 
the same as a tyrant.They lived happily in their freedom, without, in many cases, 
even knowing the name of the president of the republic, and they only knew that 
a government existed when the military chiefs passed through their territory 
searching for males to draft as soldiers, or when the government’s tax collectors 
made visits to collect levies.The government has been, then, for a great portion of 
the Mexican population, the tyrant that uprooted the hard-working Mexican men 
from their homes to make them soldiers, or it has been the brutal profiteer who 
snatched taxes from them in the name of the state treasury. 
</p>

<p>
Could these villages have felt that it was necessary to have a govern¬ 
ment? They had no need for it, and thus they were able to live for hundreds of 
years, until their natural wealth was stolen from them by the hacendados (great 
landowners). They did not devour each other, as those who have only known 
the capitalist system fear might happen, because under capitalism, every human 
being must compete with every other to be able to lift a crust of bread to his 
mouth. In these villages the strong did not tyrannize the weak, as they do in 
capitalist civilization, in which the most knavish, the most greedy, and the most 
clever dominate the good and the noble. All were brothers in these communities; 
everyone helped everyone else, and with all feeling equal, as they truly are, they 
did not need any authority to watch over the interests of owners, who dread pos¬ 
sible assault by those who have nothing. 
</p>

<p>
Right now, is government needed by the free communities of the Yaqui, 
in Durango, in southern Mexico, and in the many other communities throughout 
the country where the people have taken possession of the earth? From the mo¬ 
ment that they considered each other as equals, with the same right to Mother 
Earth, they have not needed a ruler to protect privileges against those who do not 
have privileges, because everyone was privileged.

Disabuse yourselves of illusions, proletarians: government must only ex¬ 
ist when there is economic inequality. Therefore, adopt as your moral guide the

<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
To want rulers and at the same time to want to be free is to want the 
impossible. One must choose definitively one or the other: to be free, entirely free, 
refusing all authority, or to be slaves, perpetuating man’s command over man.

A ruler or governor is necessary only under a system of economic in¬ 
equality If I have more than Pedro, I fear, naturally, that Pedro may seize me by 
the throat and take from me what he needs. In this case, a governor or ruler is 
needed to protect me against the possible attacks of Pedro; but if Pedro and I are 
economically equals, if the two of us have the same opportunity to take advantage 
of the natural riches, such as the earth, the water, the forests, as well as the riches 
created by the hands of man, such as the machinery, the houses, the railroads, and 
the thousand and one manufactured objects, reason indicates that it would be 
impossible that Pedro and I would grab each other by the hair fighting over things 
we both enjoy equally; and in this case, there would be no need to have a ruler. 
</p>

<p>
To speak of a ruler among equals is a contradiction, unless one is speak¬ 
ing of equals in servitude, of brothers in chains, as we workers currently are. 
</p>

<p>
There are many who say that it is impossible to live without a ruler or a 
government; when it is the bourgeoisie who say such things, we admit they are 
right, because they fear that the poor will seize them by the throat and take back 
from them the riches they amassed by making workers sweat. But why do the 
poor need a ruler or government? 
</p>

<p>
In Mexico, we have had and we still have hundreds of proofs that hu¬ 
manity does not need a ruler or a government except when economic inequality 
exists. In the villages or rural communities, the inhabitants have not felt the need 
</p>

One of these little magazines says: “In these moments our bourgeoisie 
laughs and makes jokes about our party (the so-called Partido Socialista de Mexi¬ 
co). Likewise the German bourgeoisie laughed a few years ago and today they’ve 
seen how four million citizen socialists have sent 110 representatives to parlia¬ 
ment, including one from the district in which the emperor lives. Now they don’t 
laugh, but rather look from one to the other anxiously. What will happen in the 
next election? Perhaps the social revolution.” 
</p>

<p>
As can be seen, the little periodical to which I’ll continue to refer consid¬ 
ers the German Social Democratic Party as a party which can accomplish noth¬ 
ing less than the social revolution, when in reality this party is recognized in the 
entire intelligent world as a conservative party like any other bourgeois party, and 
so inoffensive to the capitalist class that many of the rich participate in it. 
</p>

<p>
One couldn’t ask for greater submission or greater degradation! And all 
of this is said when the proletarians have taken up the red flag and fight like 
heroes on the battlefields! It’s bad enough when such things are said in times of 
peace; but not even then would we allow such a cynical attempt to annihilate one 
of the major virtues of the Mexican people: its spirit of rebellion. 
</p>

<p>
Workers: you don’t need to appoint idlers to represent you in the legisla¬ 
tive chambers, and much less do you need to resort to the authorities to patronize 
and represent you in your struggles against capital.To those who ask you to vote 
for them to represent you in the legislative chambers, spit in their faces; to those 
who counsel you to put your fates in the hands of authority, slap them in the 
face. In the German parliament, say those who would swindle you, there are 110 
socialist deputies. And what benefit has the working class in the German empire 
received from this great number of leeches? Misery is greater every day in the en¬ 
tire empire; people are literally dying of hunger; and the poor sections of the great 
cities are literally filled with rags and miserable flesh rotting in its own filth. And 
while this happens the socialist deputies tranquilly receive large salaries, taken 
in the form of taxes from all this misery, filth, and pain of the proletariat; and 
[August] Bebel, the Pontifice Maximo of German socialism, lives the grand life 
devouring his income in the presence of the nakedness and hunger of millions 
and millions who wait, hoping that a socialist government will put in their hands 
the lands and the means of production. And these poor people will continue to 
wait until desperation pushes them to pick up a gun to secure their economic, 
political, and social emancipation via the logical means: violence! 
</p>

<p>
While the worker rejects the bullet for the ballot box, he can’t wonder 
at being a wage slave. No more! Enough of your farces, you swindlers! All around

THE POLITICAL SOCIALISTS

(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
The swindlers speak to you of the “necessity” of the workers having rep¬ 
resentation in the legislative chambers, and they speak to you precisely in these 
moments of pressing action, when the campesinos, arms in hand, are taking pos¬ 
session of the lands; when the laborers, disillusioned with strikes, are uniting with 
rebel forces to conquer their economic liberty; when we ourselves put the provi¬ 
sions stored in the great haciendas of the Rio Grande district in the state of Coa- 
huila into the hands of the poor; and when we invite the inhabitants of this vast 
region to take possession of the lands and instruments of production, or equally 
to invade the inherited lands of the hacendados of Durango and the great planta¬ 
tions of the slavers in the lakes region; when in the entire area of Mexican soil, 
from sea to sea, and from border to border, one hears the formidable cries:“Down 
with hunger!” and “Expropriate!” 
</p>

<p>
What a wonderfully opportune time the swindlers of the proletariat have 
picked to preach about political action! Two small periodicals from Mexico City 
have arrived at our editing desk; they have appeared with the pretension of rep¬ 
resenting the interests of the working class, which is a very strange thing given 
that neither of them breathes a word about the class war which is raging in the 
Mexican republic. On the contrary, they feign to ignore it due to the orientation 
of their editors, who view with terror the path that the Mexican proletariat has 
chosen—violence—to yank from the grasping claws of the bourgeoisie the social 
riches to which it clings; rather, the editors of these little periodicals are trying 
to put to sleep the powerful revolutionary energies which are giving good proof 
while being put to the test, and to convert the revolutionaries into an electoral 
flock.

<p>
rather we should take it ourselves, refusing to recognize the “right” of the rich to 
keep for themselves the earth that belongs to all. 
</p>

<p>
Both the Madero and Diaz partisans come to the people, as do all frauds 
when they need the force of the people.This has always happened, and it will 
continue to happen until the people open their eyes and send their eternal swin¬ 
dlers to hell. “The emancipation of the workers must be the task of the workers 
themselves.”We can’t wait for the rich to give to us; we must take! We can’t ex¬ 
tend our hands to receive alms.We must resolve to do everything under our own 
power! 
</p>

<p>
The fact that Madero or Diaz would give some land to some people 
doesn’t resolve the problem of hunger.The lands should be for all, and should not 
be sold as Diaz and Madero claim, with the people paying over time.This would 
recognize the so-called right of private property.The bourgeois respect this right; 
the poor can’t recognize it because it’s hideously unfair. The lands shouldn’t be 
for just a few, but for all. 
</p>

<p>
Comrades: this is the moment in which we should be intransigent in our 
demands. Already the bourgeoisie and the government tremble at the possibility 
of seeing themselves dethroned. Let’s not stop; let’s not vacillate. While Diaz and 
Madero respect the “right” of private property, while this “right” subsists, don’t 
expect your liberation. It is necessary to recognize this for what it is: we can’t pull 
back because the bourgeoisie and its lackeys call us bandits.They are the bandits, 
they who have lived at the cost of the blood, sweat, tears, pain, and desperation 
of a thousand generations of workers.They are the bandits, they who have never 
had anything for the workers except maltreatment, contempt, judges, cops, jail¬ 
ers, gallows. Don’t forget these wrongs! The bourgeoisie are our enemies! Throw 
them down! Blood is running in torrents. Let it be for the redemption of the pro¬ 
letariat and not to elevate another bandit. 
</p>

<p>
We must be firm in our purpose to convert this political movement into 
a social revolution. Don’t ask for the earth.Take it! 
</p>

<p>
The revolution of the Partido Liberal is gaining ground. We have confi¬ 
dence that within a year the red flag will wave sovereign over all of Mexico. But I 
don’t want to say with this that the revolution is going to last a year.That’s a very 
short time for a true revolution. Diaz will fall in less than a year, but the revolution 
will continue because the people will not gain their liberty with the fall of this 
tyrant. What is needed is the fall of the present social, political, and economic sys¬ 
tem. Let those leave our ranks who are cowards and those who expect to prosper 
after an easy triumph; let march out of the ranks of the Partido Liberal Mexicano

<p>
equality, the right to live, a right which can only exist when the lands are under 
the control of each and every one of the inhabitants of Mexico. 
</p>

<p>
The propagation of such health ideals has been the result of the rapid 
growth in influence of the Partido Liberal Mexicano. In little over six months 
of propaganda headed by Regeneration, we’ve seen the more than satisfactory 
results of this propaganda. Hundreds are joining the party every month. Member¬ 
ship forms are signed every day by companeros and companeras convinced of the 
necessity of employing direct action to take possession of the earth, ignoring the 
“sacred right of private property.” 
</p>

<p>
The movements of Diaz and Madero, upon seeing the growing power of 
the Partido Liberal Mexicano,have remembered the people and have bowed down 
toward it saying, “We’re also your friends; we’re going to give you the lands.” 
</p>

<p>
Diaz has said that he’ll spend 80 million pesos buying lands from the 
rich to give to the poor. Madero offers the same thing; but now is not the time to 
be fooled, comrades. Before the resolute attitude of the Partido Liberal, Diaz has 
pulled in his claws and the bourgeois Madero has done the same thing. 
</p>

<p>
Neither Diaz nor Madero can deliver on their promise of lands for the 
people. In order to do so, they would have to ignore the “right” of private prop¬ 
erty, because to pretend to buy the lands is the dream of a crazy man.There isn’t 
enough capital in the world to buy the lands of Mexico. How then are Diaz or 
Madero going to buy it with the humble resources of the national treasury? The 
budget, in terms of income and expenses, in normal times, is always out of bal¬ 
ance. Income is always less than expenses, and this is what happens in normal 
times. What condition will the budget be in when this country emerges from this 
war? With business paralyzed, and misery and hunger everywhere? From what are 
Madero and Diaz going to draw the resources to buy the land from the rich and 
give it to the poor? 
</p>

<p>
If in normal times there aren’t enough taxes gathered in the country to 
pay for the costs of the public administration, and if it’s necessary to resort to 
loans to sustain this spending, it’ll be much harder to pay these costs after the cur¬ 
rent insurrection. There will hardly be enough for Diaz or Madero to reimburse 
themselves for their own expenses. It is, then, economically impossible to buy the 
land from the rich, and when the partisans of Madero and Diaz speak of this they 
are shamefully deceiving the workers because they’re offering something they 
can’t deliver. 
</p>

<p>
What ought to be done is not to buy the land, but to seize it from the 
hands of the rich; and we shouldn’t wait for a merciful government to do it, but

celebrate its vices, play to its preoccupations. This, naturally, is done when the 
politician needs the support of the people, in those abnormal moments when 
the passive masses commence to stir, bitten by rebellion; but in normal times, the 
masses are back to being kicked around and whipped. 
</p>

<p>
Porfirio Diaz and Francisco I. Madero feel in these moments the need to 
unite, in their own turn, with the popular masses. The first of these has been a 
savage beast who has sustained his dominion by cutting the throats of the Mexi¬ 
can race; the second has been an evil hacendado [large rancher] who has accu¬ 
mulated millions and millions [of pesos] exploiting the peons on his haciendas 
in the state of Coahuila.Well then, these two types of oppressors—the political 
oppressor and the economic oppressor—try to drag the masses behind them, 
offering to alleviate their sad condition. But it’s necessary to remain conscious 
of who is doing this at the precise moment that the workers are commencing to 
wake up and realize the iniquities they suffer: political despotism and economic 
tyranny. While the workers were dreaming of the panacea of “real suffrage,” while 
they had faith in the good will of the legislators and paternalistic governments, 
both Diaz and Madero had no interest in studying methods of alleviating the suf¬ 
fering of the poor. But the Partido Liberal has spoken loudly; the Partido Liberal 
has opened the eyes of the workers; it has clearly explained that no congress can 
work in favor of the proletariat, because it isn’t proletarians who sit in congresses, 
but rather the bourgeoisie, and the bourgeoisie has an interest in keeping the 
proletariat permanently enslaved.The Partido Liberal has shown, through history, 
that movements headed by the ruling classes in society, that is, by the intellectu¬ 
als and the rich, will carry the people to the slaughterhouse, but never to liberty, 
precisely because the interests of the rich and the intellectuals are diametrically 
opposed to the interests of the workers.The most that revolutionary movements 
have achieved, in all lands throughout history, is the attainment of the already 
discredited “human rights,” which guarantee everything except that which is es¬ 
sential: the means of subsistence. Take a look at the Constitution of 1857, and 
in no part of it will you encounter a single line that guarantees the right to live, 
and this is because the bourgeoisie has guaranteed everything it needs to take 
advantage of the constitution; but it doesn’t guarantee that which the working 
class needs, since everything that the working class truly needs for its emancipa¬ 
tion and dignity has been forgotten by the legislators; and since the politicians 
have forgotten the people, it’s time that the working people, on their own count, 
produce a movement which pushes directly toward the establishment of social 
</p>


<p>
254 ★ DREAMS OF FREEDOM 
</p>




<p>
That’s how it was, because the proletarians had confidence in their lead¬ 
ers and believed that their leaders could deliver the miracle of a good government; 
and they put in the hands of the ruling classes of society, precisely in the hands 
of the classes that are the natural enemies of the working class, the resolution of 
their problems. Ninety years of swindles on the part of the economic and intel¬ 
lectual ruling elites have opened the eyes of, if not all, at least of a good number 
of workers, who have understood in the end that the lands and the machinery 
of production cannot fall into the hands of the proletarians if they participate 
in elections that name another exploiter, but only through the manly actions of 
workers armed with guns and dynamite. 
</p>

<p>
Proletarians who work militantly in the files of Vazquez or Orosco: wher¬ 
ever you are, open warehouses and granaries so that the poor will be able to eat, 
and put the lands and the industries in the hands of the workers. Only in this 
manner will the purposes of this great revolution avoid disappointment. If your 
leaders and officials oppose this, shoot them without compassion! Neighbors of 
the towns and cities that are in the hands of the rebels: don’t pay rents for the 
houses you occupy, and if the forces of Vazquez or Orosco want to make you pay, 
blow them up with dynamite, because the revolution should be for the benefit of 
the poor and not the bourgeoisie.

<p>
It’s always the same. When the bourgeoisie feels that it needs the support 
of the masses to assure its domination, when it feels the emptiness around it, it 
decides to descend a little, to lower itself to where the proletariat vegetates, and 
to smile at it, to pass a hand over its back, and to tell it: “I’m your friend, your hard¬ 
ships bother me, and I want to alleviate your pain.” And, regularly, the proletariat 
curls up and gets sleepy listening to the political siren song, and it forgets the 
humiliation it’s been subjected to for thousands of years by its haughty bosses.

All politicians have a good feel for the popular pulse. He who wants to 
live above the people has to do no more than adulate it, applaud its passions,

DOWN WITH THE FRAUDS! 
</p>

<p>
Regeneration, March 9, 1912 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
The revolution gains ground with every passing moment. The “holy” 
right of private property, in contrast, loses ground with every instant, to say noth¬ 
ing of authority, which, sliding into the abyss, with no respect, clutches in vain 
at the law—that poor weed which doesn’t have the power to stop its fall—or at 
arbitrariness, that sword which wounds the aggressor as much as the aggressed 
upon. 
</p>

<p>
Events have unfolded with such rapidity that the fall of Madero will not 
dispirit those impatient to occupy his post and the posts of his favorites, but the 
revolution continues its triumphant march; it will not be detained by the mere 
occupancy of the presidential seat by a Vazquez Gomez or an Orozco. In the 
mountains, on the plains, wherever there is a man with heart, the struggle will 
continue against capital, authority, and the church. 
</p>

<p>
The people are no longer satisfied with promises. From 1821 [the year 
Mexico achieved independence from Spain] to date, all of the ambitious ones 
have made promises, all of those who have had their eyes on coming to power 
have presented the people with shining programs which must be carried out af¬ 
ter the revolution; and in every case, without a single exception, the dispossessed 
have been fooled.Those who aspired to be rulers as well as the simple hunters of 
jobs have told the people: rise up and I’ll make you happy. And the people have 
risen up, shed their blood, have sacrificed themselves so that, come the day of the 
triumph, the leaders will take possession of great offices, while the soldiers, de¬ 
prived of their arms so that they won’t constitute a danger, have been dispatched 
back to their homes, where their families anxiously awaited them, afflicted by 
hunger, bitten by the cold, but with the hope of “a change” in their sad conditions 
of life. No change ever came: the humble hero of a hundred battles turned again 
to taking up the hammer or other instruments of labor for his bosses, exactly 
the same as before; daughters of the people continued to be sweet meats for the 
bosses; conscription didn’t disappear with the rise of the new government; hun¬ 
ger continued to gnaw at the flesh of the proletarians; the children of the workers 
wallowed in the same mud and grew up in the same ignorance, exactly the same 
as the children of the previous generation.

<p>
The soldier with gun in hand, the policeman with the hangman’s noose 
in hand, the rural cop with his saber drawn—have they ever served to protect the 
weak? Has there ever been a case in which the soldier, the policeman, the rural 
cop have interposed themselves between the boss and the worker in order to 
stop the first from sucking the blood of the second? When the poor man hasn’t 
been able to pay the rent on his land or house, have the soldier, the policeman, 
the rural cop ever flown to his aid to prevent his being tossed into the street or 
tossed off the land which he’s watered with his sweat? And if we rebel, outraged 
by the social injustice which obliges us to put our muscles and brains at the ser¬ 
vice of the rich, will authority take our part, that is, the part of the weak, of the 
victims of voracious capitalism? Won’t we see, instead, that the soldiers, police¬ 
men, and rural cops will bring death to the poor who want to bring about a more 
equitable distribution of bread? 
</p>

<p>
I say that the rich scream to high heaven when they hear the redemp- 
tory cry: “Death to Authority! ” But I don’t say that the poor, the shabbily dressed, 
the workers become angry and sputter in rage when we give them this friendly 
advice: “Don’t elect authorities; govern yourselves.” 
</p>

<p>
[Octave] Mirbeau spoke a great truth when he exclaimed:“Of all animals, 
man is the stupidest, because at least the animals don’t elect the butcher who slits 
their throats.” 
</p>

<p>
And men, while we kill ourselves for the benefit of those who draw the 
knife across our throats when they’re in power, yes, we are stupid! 
</p>

<p>
We'll give our liberty, our tranquility, our blood, not to elect exploiters, 
but to put an end to them, to put an end to the bourgeoisie, to found the free 
society of all for one and one for all. 
</p>

<p>
Let’s elevate to power neither Vazquez Gomez nor anyone else. Let’s at 
least be as dignified as the animals who don’t elect a butcher to cut their throats. 
Let us take the earth, the machinery of production, the means of transportation, 
the houses, the provisions; let us fraternally organize ourselves for production 
and consumption in common, and raise our heads, Mexicans, proud of having 
known how to resolve the social problem.

<p>
DEATH TO AUTHORITY! 
</p>

<p>
Regeneration, March 23, 1912 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
I tell you the rich scream to high heaven when they hear the redemptory 
cry:“Death to Authority!”They have good reason, because if authority disappears 
the privileges of capital will fall into the same grave, never to rise again. Authority 
is necessary to social inequality; it guarantees that the rich will live in idleness 
while it condemns the poor to hard labor and abject misery.The bourgeoisie then, 
need authority, because without it they would have to take up the plow, the wood 
plane, or the hammer to gain subsistence for themselves and their families. 
</p>

<p>
But the poor man, why does he need authority? Authority has never been 
to his benefit. For the poor, authority has always been the abusive, foul-tempered 
stepmother, the castrator of wills. And I know of no land on Earth where author¬ 
ity has been the shield or guardian angel of the poor, and this is because it can’t 
serve two bosses at the same time: the rich and the poor. Authority was instituted 
to guard the material goods of the rich class, which sees itself menaced by the 
hungry. 
</p>

<p>
Those of us who don’t have a clump of dirt on which to lie our heads 
don’t need authority. On the contrary, we detest it because it snatches from our 
files the most vigorous of our brothers, stockpiling them in the barracks and mak¬ 
ing them take up arms for the bourgeoisie; and in the second place we detest it 
because it extorts money from us to maintain these soldiers and the whole gang 
of great and small functionaries called government. 
</p>

<p>
We ourselves, the dispossessed, those who have nothing they can steal, 
are those who are obliged to pay the costs of maintaining authority, when what is 
just is that these costs would be paid by those who benefit from it, the bourgeoi¬ 
sie.

<p>
the rest. And a leader will never look favorably upon the intention of the poor 
to install a social system based on the economic, political, and social equality of 
human beings.The reason for this is that such a system doesn’t guarantee lead¬ 
ers the easy, lazy life they want to lead, full of honors and glory, at the cost of the 
sacrifice of the humble. 
</p>

<p>
So then, Mexican brothers, learn to work under your own initiative to 
bring into practice those noble principles set forth in our manifesto of September 
23, 1911. 
</p>

<p>
We don’t consider ourselves your leaders, and it would sadden us if you’d 
see in us chiefs to follow, and without whom you wouldn’t dare to do anything 
to further the cause. We re on the verge of going to prison, not because we’re 
criminals, but because we won’t sell out—neither to the rich nor to the authori¬ 
ties; we don’t want to tyrannize over you by accepting public posts or bundles 
of bank notes, converting ourselves into the bourgeoisie who exploit your labor. 
We don’t consider ourselves your leaders, but rather your brothers, and we’ll go 
contentedly to prison if you don’t let it interfere with your confrontations with 
capital and authority. 
</p>

<p>
Don’t be part of the masses, Mexicans; don’t be part of the multitude 
dragged along by the politician or the rich man or the military chieftain. Think 
with your own heads and do what your own consciences dictate. 
</p>

<p>
Don’t become discouraged when you see us separated from you by the 
black gate of the prison. Then you’ll lack our friendly words and nothing more; 
but selfless comrades will continue publishing Regeneration. Lend them your 
support, because they’re going to continue this propaganda effort which must 
become even more widespread and more radical. 
</p>

<p>
Don’t do what you did last year when we were arrested; then your enthu¬ 
siasm cooled, and your resolve to further by any means necessary the destruction 
of the capitalist, authoritarian system weakened, with very few of you holding 
firm. Be firm now; don’t become fixated on our personalities, and with renewed 
enthusiasm lend your moral, material, and individual support to the revolution of 
the poor against the rich and against authority. 
</p>

<p>
Let each one of you be your own leader; there’s no other necessity than 
that you push yourselves to continue the struggle. Don’t call yourselves leaders; 
simply take possession of the lands and all else that exists, and apply yourselves 
to being free of your bosses and authority. In this way peace will come of its own 
accord, as a natural result of the well-being and freedom of all; but if you allow 
the accursed bourgeois education you received to influence you, and you lift up

<p>
THE LEADERS 
</p>

<p>
Regeneration, June 15, 1912 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
It’s not necessary to be part of the masses; it’s not necessary to have the 
biases, the prejudgments, the mistaken beliefs, the habits of the unconscious mul¬ 
titudes. The masses have the firm belief that it’s necessary to have a leader or a 
man on a white horse at their head, that hell conduct them toward their destiny, 
that he’ll carry them to tyranny or liberty; the question is whether he’ll lead them 
with kindness or by spitting on them toward the good or the bad. 
</p>

<p>
This customary belief, so deep rooted in human beings, is the fount of 
innumerable evils for the cause of those working to redeem the human species. 
Life, honor, well-being, the future, liberty—all are put in the hands of the man who 
the masses make the leader. It’s the leader who has to think for all; it’s the leader 
who is entrusted with watching over the common well-being and liberties of the 
masses in general and of the individual in particular, which results in the millions 
of minds that constitute the masses not thinking, because the leader is entrusted 
to think for all. This gives rise to the passivity of the masses, that they don’t un¬ 
dertake any initiative themselves, and that they carry on a sheep-like existence, 
being flattered by politicians and aspirants to public office in times of elections, 
but who later turn on them. In times of revolutionary action, they’re swindled by 
the ambitious, who reward them with a kick in the ass after the victory. 
</p>

<p>
It’s not necessary to be part of the masses; it’s necessary to be united as 
a group of thinking individuals, united in order to obtain common ends; it’s nec¬ 
essary that every one, man or woman, think with their own head, that every one 
make the effort of having an opinion about what is necessary to obtain our goals, 
which are nothing other than the liberty of all founded in the liberty of every one, 
the well-being of all founded in the well-being of every one. And for us to arrive at 
this, it is necessary to destroy that which opposes it: inequality. It is necessary that 
the lands, the tools, the machines, the provisions, the houses, everything thing 
that exists, be it a natural product or a product of industry, pass from the hands of 
the few who presently have it all to the hands of everyone, men and women alike, 
so that we can produce in common, everyone producing according to his abilities 
and everyone consuming according to his needs.

To achieve this we don’t need leaders; on the contrary, they impede this, 
because the leader wants to dominate, wants to be obeyed, wants to be above

<p>
The fear of the of the unknown contributes strongly to the resistance 
of the mind of the masses against the new ideals. The cowardice of the herd is 
perfectly expressed in the phrase that issues from the mouths of all the swindlers: 
“The devil you know is better than the one you don’t.”The fruits of old ideals are 
bitter: nevertheless, the imbecility and the cowardice of the masses prefers them 
to the cultivation of new, healthy ideals. 
</p>

<p>
The sower of ideals must struggle against the masses, who are conserva¬ 
tive, against institutions, which are likewise conservative; and alone, surrounded 
by the comings and goings of a herd that does not understand him, he walks 
through the world not hoping for any reward more than fools slapping him in 
the face, tyrants throwing him in jail and, at any moment, the scaffold. Yet never¬ 
theless, as long as he can sow, sow, sow, the sower of seeds will continue sowing, 
sowing, sowing&#x2026;

SOWING

Regeneration, November 5, 1910 
(Translated by M.V) 
</p>

<p>
I can imagine the satisfactions and the worries of the sower of seeds. 
What emotions the man who plants the grain in the earth must feel! Behold a 
wasteland; yet the sower of seeds comes and turns over the earth, slices it up, 
breaks up the rough clods of earth, combs it over, sows the grain, and irrigates 
it. After this, he waits! However, this waiting does not consist of just crossing his 
arms: he must struggle; he must struggle against the birds who descend to eat the 
kernels, against the animals who feed upon the tender shoots, against the cold, 
against the streams that threaten to overflow, against the weeds which spread to 
cover the seed.With what emotion he awaits the new day anticipating whether 
he will see the green tips of the plants breaking forth from the black earth! Finally, 
they appear, and then he lifts his worried gaze to the skies; he knows how to read 
the coming weather in the clouds; likewise, the direction that the wind blows has 
great importance. Looking at the clouds, surveying the winds, his face will grow 
pale or will glow, depending on whether he deduces the coming of fair, good, or 
poor weather. 
</p>

<p>
However, these tortures are not at all comparable to those suffered by 
the sower of ideals.The earth welcomes tenderly.The mind of the human masses 
refuses to welcome the ideals that the sower places into it.The weeds, the under¬ 
growth represented by old ideals, by preoccupations, by traditions, by prejudices 
have established themselves so much, have sunk their roots so deeply, and have 
cross-pollinated to such an extent that it is not easy to exterminate them without 
resistance, without making the patient suffer. The sower of ideals casts the seed, 
but the weeds are thick and cast such dense shadows that most of the time noth¬ 
ing germinates; and if, despite this resistance, the seed of ideals is endowed with 
such vitality, with such vigorous potency, that it succeeds in making a sprout 
emerge, it grows feeble, sickly, because the old weeds feed off of its essence, and 
this is why it takes so much effort for the new ideals to successfully take root.

BANDITS! 
</p>

<p>
Regeneration, December 9, 1911

(Translated by M.V) 
</p>

<p>
This is the name that the people in charge have given us.Why? Because, 
as well as teaching our miserable brothers that all that exists should be for all 
people, we also invite them to take possession of all of it. 
</p>

<p>
Who made the earth? The frock-coated, gloved gentlemen who say it be¬ 
longs to them; did they make it? No; the land is a natural good, common to all 
living creatures. Who made the houses, the clothing, everything that makes life 
comfortable? Was it the gentlemen living in rich palaces and lodging in luxurious 
hotels? No; all of this emerged from the hands of poor people who live in hovels, 
who are rotting in prisons, who are withering in the bordellos, who are dying all 
over the world, in hospitals, in the middle of the road, on the gallows&#x2026; 
</p>

<p>
Bandits! We who want to put an end to banditry! 
</p>

<p>
No, bourgeois gentlemen: the bandits are all of you who, without any 
right, have usurped the natural goods which you have not created, and which 
are the products of men who labor so that you would not have to spill a drop of 
sweat. 
</p>

<p>
You are all bandits, you bourgeois gentlemen who have, through the law 
that pimps for your rapacity, illegally taken most of what the workers have pro¬ 
duced without your risking being caged in a jail cell. Ah! Between bandit and 
bandit, I prefer the one who, dagger in hand and with a resolute spirit, jumps out 
from some thicket by the road shouting “Your money or your lire!" I prefer this 
one, I insist, to the bandit who, sitting down at his desk, coldly, quietly, calmly 
drinks the blood of his workers. 
</p>

<p>
As for the first bandit, the one who attacks and faces danger in his daring 
adventure, there is prison or the firing squad; for the white-gloved bandit, there is 
respect, honor, contentment. 
</p>

<p>
This is how things pass under the present system of supreme social injus¬ 
tice. For the honored people in charge, robbery is not a crime if one robs a great 
deal; but it is if the robber is a mere “hoodlum.”A banker, a businessman can make 
deals which bring sadness to hundreds of thousands of homes: this is considered 
to be a skillful financial operation. A ravenous man takes a piece of bread from a 
shop: this man is a thief.

<p>
Expropriation is achieved through trampling over the law, not by lifting it 
to the heavens. 
</p>

<p>
For this reason, revolutionaries must necessarily be outlaws. We must 
abandon the well-worn road of conventionality and open up with our whiplashes 
upon the old flesh new paths out of the conventional ruts. 
</p>

<p>
Here we are, with the torch of the revolution in one hand and the pro¬ 
gram of the Partido Liberal in the other, announcing war.We are not whining mes¬ 
sengers of peace: we are revolutionaries. Our electoral ballots will be the bullets 
our guns fire. From today onwards, the swords wielded by the mercenaries of 
Caesar will encounter not the defenseless breast of the citizen who exercises his 
civic functions, but the bayonets of the rebels ready to repay blow with blow. 
</p>

<p>
It would be senseless to respond through the law to someone who does 
not respect the law; it would be absurd to open statute books to defend ourselves 
from an attack with a bayonet or from being shot down as a fugitive. Do they take 
revenge? We take revenge! Do they want to subdue us with their gunshots? We 
will subdue them with our gunshots as well! 
</p>

<p>
Now, let’s get to work.We must separate out the cowards: we do not want 
them; only the valiant enlist in the revolution. 
</p>

<p>
Here we are, as always, at our combat station. Martyrdom has made us 
stronger and more resolved. We are ready for the greatest sacrifices. We are com¬ 
ing to the Mexican people to tell them that their day of liberation is drawing 
near. On the new horizon, the splendid aurora of the new day is shining; to our 
ears comes the sound of the storm of salvation of a humanity about to unshackle 
itself: it is the ferment of the revolutionary spirit; it is that the entire country is a 
volcano on the verge of angrily spitting out the fire buried in its core. “No more 
peace! ”is the shout of the valiant; better death than a shameful peace.The flowing 
hair of the future heroes floats on the air blown by the first gusts of the coming 
cataclysm. 
</p>

<p>
A sharp, strong, and healthy spirit of war emboldens the effeminate at- 
mosphere.The apostle will proclaim from one ear to the next how and when the 
cataclysm will begin, and rifles are impatiently awaiting the moment when they

OUTLAWS 
</p>

<p>
Regeneracion, September 3, 1910 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by M.V.) 
</p>

<p>
The true revolutionary is an outlaw par excellence.The man who adjusts 
his actions to conform to the law, can be, at best, a good domestic animal, but not 
a revolutionary. 
</p>

<p>
The law conserves; the revolution renews. For the same reason if one 
must renew, one must begin by breaking the Law. 
</p>

<p>
Claiming that the revolution can be made within the law is lunacy, is a 
contradiction.The law is a yoke, and he who wants to free himself from the yoke 
must break it. 
</p>

<p>
He who preaches to the workers that they may secure emancipation 
through the law is a charlatan, because the law ordains that we cannot snatch 
from the hands of the rich the wealth they have robbed from us; and the expro¬ 
priation of the wealth for the benefit of all is the condition without which human 
emancipation cannot triumph. 
</p>

<p>
The law is a brake, and with the brakes on we’ll never arrive at liberty. 
The law castrates, and the castrated can not aspire to be men. 
</p>

<p>
Throughout history, the liberties conquered by the human species have 
been the work of outlaws who took the law into their own hands and tore it to 
pieces.

<p>
The tyrant dies from stab wounds, not from articles of the legal code.

<p>
THE UTOPIANS 
</p>

<p>
Regeneracion, November 12, 1910 
</p>

<p>
(translated by M.V) 
</p>

<p>
“Dreamers, Utopians!” this is the least said about us, and this has been the 
conservatives’ cry at all times against those who try to place a foot outside the 
corral that imprisons the human herd. 
</p>

<p>
“Dreamers, Utopians!” they yell at us,and when they know that our rec¬ 
lamation begins with taking possession of the land so that we can hand it over to 
the people, their cries become sharper and their insults stronger:“thieves, wicked 
murders, traitors,” they call us. 
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, in all eras, the progress of humanity has been due to the 
dreamers and the Utopians.This thing called civilization, what is it if not the re¬ 
sult of efforts by Utopians? The visionaries, the poets, the dreamers, the Utopians, 
so disdained by “serious” people, so persecuted by the paternalism of govern¬ 
ments; lynched here, shot down there, burnt to death, tortured, imprisoned, torn 
to pieces in all epochs and all countries, these people nevertheless, have been 
the engines of all progressive movements; they have been the prophets who have 
pointed the blind masses towards luminous paths leading to glorious summits. 
</p>

<p>
One would abandon all progress or, better, one would abandon all hope 
for justice and human betterment if in the span of even one century the hu¬ 
man family could no longer count dreamers, Utopians, and visionaries among its 
members. Which persons are on the list of the dead who these “serious” people 
admire so much? What were they if not visionaries? Why are they so admired if 
not because they were dreamers? What covers them in glory if not their utopian 
character? 
</p>

<p>
From this scorned group of human beings sprang forth Socrates, dis¬ 
dained by the “serious” and “sensible” people of his epoch and who is now ad¬ 
mired by the same kind of people who made him swallow hemlock. Christ? If 
the “sensible” and “serious” people of today had lived in that epoch, they would 
have judged him, sentenced him, and even nailed the great utopian to the defiling 
cross—and now they cross themselves and kneel before his image. 
</p>

<p>
There has never been a revolutionary, in the social sense of the word, 
there has never been a reformer who the authorities of his epoch have not at¬ 
tacked as a utopian, visionary, and dreamer.

market, which is another kind of prostitution sanctioned by the law and autho¬ 
rized by a public functionary And marriage is nothing other than prostitution 
when a woman weds without love, but solely with the intent of finding a man to 
support her, that is, as she does in the majority of marriages, she sells her body for 
food, just like a fallen woman. 
</p>

<p>
And what can be said about the immense army of women who do not 
find a spouse? The growing shortage of primary goods, the disturbing decrease in 
wages for human labor resulting from the perfection of machinery, together will 
all of the more and more pressing demands the modern world creates, are inca¬ 
pacitating man economically from taking upon himself the burden of maintaining 
a family. Obligatory military service, which seizes a great number of strong young 
males from the bosom of society, further diminishes the masculine supply in the 
matrimonial marketplace.The emigration of workers, provoked by various eco¬ 
nomic and political reasons, reduces the number of men capable of entering into 
matrimony even further. Alcoholism, gambling, and other vices and illnesses re¬ 
duce even more the quantity of marriage candidates. All this results in an extreme 
reduction in the number of men suitable for marriage and, as a consequence, the 
number of single women is alarming. As single women’s financial situation is very 
stressful, prostitution increasingly expands its ranks and the human race degener¬ 
ates further through the debasement of the flesh and the spirit. 
</p>

<p>
Women comrades: this is the dreadful scene that modern societies offer. 
In this scene, you see that men and women suffer equally from the tyranny of a 
political and social environment that is in complete disaccord with the develop¬ 
ment of civilization and the advances of philosophy. In your moments of worry, 
stop raising your beautiful eyes to heaven: that is where are those who have con¬ 
tributed most to making you eternal slaves.The remedy is here on Earth, and it is 
rebellion.

goats, built the cottage, made fabric into clothing, cooked the food, and cared for 
the sick and the children.The dirtiest jobs were performed by the woman. If an ox 
died of fatigue, the woman took its place hauling the plough. When a war flared 
up between two enemy tribes, the woman’s owner changed, but she continued, 
under the lash of her new master, to perform the tasks of a beast of burden. 
</p>

<p>
Later, under the influence of Greek civilization, woman ascended a few 
steps in the regard of men. She was no longer the primitive clan’s beast of bur¬ 
den, nor did she live a cloistered life as in Oriental societies. At that time, if she 
belonged to a free family, her role was that of producer of citizens for her country, 
or of slaves, if she had the rank of a helot. 
</p>

<p>
Christianity arrived after this, worsening the situation of woman with 
its contempt for the flesh. The Great Fathers of the Church focused their hatred 
against feminine graces. Saint Augustine, Saint Thomas, and other saints before 
whose images poor women kneel, called woman the daughter of the devil, a ves¬ 
sel of impurity, and condemned her to suffer the tortures of hell. 
</p>

<p>
The condition of woman in this century varies according to her social 
class, but, despite the softening of customs, despite the progress of philosophy, 
woman continues to be subordinate to man by tradition and by law. Eternally 
treated as a minor, the law places her under the tutelage of her husband. She can¬ 
not vote or be elected, and she would have to be extremely fortunate to enter into 
civil contracts. 
</p>

<p>
Throughout the ages, woman has been considered to be an inferior be¬ 
ing to man, not just by the law, but also by custom, and this erroneous and unjust 
conception is responsible for the hardship she has suffered ever since humanity 
barely lifted itself above primitive fauna through its use of fire and the flint axe 
</p>

<p>
Humiliated, scorned, tied by the strong bonds of tradition to the pillory 
of an irrational inferiority, familiarized by a priest with the affairs of heaven, but 
totally ignorant of the problems of Earth, woman finds herself suddenly swept up 
by the whirlwind of industrial activity that needs workers, cheap workers above 
all, that takes advantage of the fact that she is not educated like men are for the 
industrial struggle, that she is not organized with those of her class to fight with 
her brother workers against the rapacity of capital. 
</p>

<p>
To this we owe the fact that women, who work more than men but earn 
less, are abused and abased and held in contempt today like they were yesterday 
—that these are the bitter fruits she harvests for a life of sacrifice. A woman’s sal¬ 
ary is so paltry that frequently she must prostitute herself to be able to support 
her family when she cannot find a man who will marry her in the matrimonial

The cataclysm is afoot. Its torch will light the blaze that will consume 
privilege and injustice. Women comrades, do not fear this cataclysm. You consti¬ 
tute half of the human species, and whatever affects it affects you as an integral 
part of humanity. If men are slaves, you will be, too. Shackles do not recognize 
gender; the infamy that shames man disgraces you as well. You cannot separate 
yourselves from the degradation of oppression. The same claw that strangles 
men’s necks strangles yours as well. 
</p>

<p>
It is therefore necessary to be in solidarity in the great contest for free¬ 
dom and happiness. Are you mothers? Are you wives? Are you sisters? Are you 
daughters? Your duty is to aid man: be with him when he vacillates—inspire him; 
fly to his side when he suffers to soothe his pain; and laugh and sing with him 
when triumph smiles. What if you do not understand politics? It is not a question 
of politics: it is a question of life and death.The chains of men are your own. Ay! 
Yours are perhaps heavier and blacker and more degrading. Are you a worker? 
Just because you are a woman, you are paid less than a man, and you are made to 
work more; you have to suffer the insolence of the foreman and the boss. If you 
are pretty as well, the bosses will assault your virtue, they will surround you, they 
will embrace you until you surrender your heart to them, and if you give up, they 
will steal it from you with the same cowardice that they steal the products of 
your labor from you.

Under the empire of social injustice where humanity rots, a woman’s 
existence oscillates within the restricted field of her destiny, whose frontiers are 
lost in the blackness of fatigue or hunger and the shadows of matrimony or pros¬ 
titution.

It is necessary to study, it is essential to see, it is indispensable to scruti¬

the flesh of the human heart, in order to realize exactly how woman participates 
in this universal suffering.

The misfortune of woman is so ancient that its origin is lost in the shad¬

<p>
The participation of women in public affairs connected to the capitalist 
system is, certainly, progress, because it’s based upon a consideration of social 
justice: that of giving the woman the same rights as the man. But it constitutes, at 
the same time, a step backward due to the hidden consequences of this feminine 
participation in political affairs, because if until now lack of feminine participa¬ 
tion was a disgrace which distracted the proletariat in the economic and social 
struggle, which should be sustained so that it can achieve its total emancipation, 
elections and other democratic farces will equally distract women in this fertile 
struggle, which has so lacked their determined cooperation; this must, naturally 
retard the triumph of anarchy. 
</p>

<p>
The politicians are astute.They clearly see that the revolution marches to¬ 
ward an anarchist society, and they go to meet it with reforms that put obstacles in 
its path, that make its march slower.This is because all reforms, even when at first 
glance they appear to be a forward step, when you get below the surface you’ll 
find that they are obstacles placed in the path of progress. 
</p>

<p>
Reform is not a medicine which produces health, but rather a sedative 
that delays it. The politicians are like quack doctors. Rather than use a medicine 
that will quickly return the patient to health, they apply sedatives in order to ex¬ 
ploit for the longest time possible the ill health of the patient.

exactly equal to the man in intelligence and that, therefore, she should have the 
same rights as he does to fill public posts. 
</p>

<p>
“The Congress of Yucatan Women intends, with this declaration, to autho¬ 
rize a campaign which will soon be initiated to make the campaigns of women in 
the upcoming Yucatan elections triumph.” 
</p>

<p>
This, so far, is the notice. 
</p>

<p>
The resolution that “the woman is exactly equal to the man in intelli¬ 
gence” is magnificent and honors the ideals of the revolution, which sees in the 
woman not an inferior, contemptible being, but rather the comrade, the sister of 
the man, with whom he ought to struggle side by side for human emancipation, 
because if humanity is enslaved, she is also enslaved, and if it is free, she is also 
free. 
</p>

<p>
We anarchists consider the woman entirely equal to the man and entitled 
to the same rights, and we observe with pleasure the important resolution of 
the Congress of Yucatan Women that declares “the woman is exactly equal to the 
man in intelligence .’’The only thing that disgusts us is that the woman aspires to 
occupy public posts, and this does disgust us—not because we’re dealing with 
women, but because we’re dealing with the preservation of the system that op¬ 
presses us equally as women and men. 
</p>

<p>
How much better it would be if the beautiful and intelligent Yucatan 
women, upon realizing that the woman is exactly equal to the man in intelligence, 
would fight for an anarchist society inside which the woman would be entirely 
equal and would obtain the maximum amount of liberty and well-being to which 
every human being is entitled. 
</p>

<p>
Within the system of private property, no matter how much the woman 
exerts and sacrifices herselft o conquer her liberty and well-being, she will never 
attain it, just as the man will never attain it. The capitalist, authoritarian system 
is not evil because men rule it, but rather because, in itself, it is a system that 
enslaves the human being from the moment that the greater number are con¬ 
demned to servitude so that a handful of parasites can enjoy all of the delights 
and enjoy all of the liberties. 
</p>

<p>
The proletarian woman, whether men or women govern, will be as much 
a slave as the proletarian man.

<p>
The evil is, then, the capitalist, authoritarian system, and it is in work¬ 
ing against this odious system that we should demonstrate ourselves, men and 
women, to be equals.

Then the paid assassins of tyranny condemned her to stand day and night

“The Congress of Women, meeting in the city of Merida, at the behest of 
General Salvador Alvarado, governor of the State of Yucatan, has ended its series 
of scheduled sessions.The final resolution of the Congress, according to informa¬

services of some excellent comrades, Margarita escaped the claws of the immi¬ 
gration inspectors and with Rosaura went to seek refuge in Phoenix, where she 
adopted the name Maria Valdes to throw off the thugs. Rosaura adopted the name 
Josefina. 
</p>

<p>
Rosaura remained ill as a consequence of the hardships suffered in the 
desert, and her only desire was to return to Mexico, but with arms in hand, fight¬ 
ing for Land and Liberty. She didn’t want to die in bed, but rather on the battlefield, 
exchanging life for life. When her illness grew so grave that she couldn’t even get 
out of bed, she said to Margarita: “Mama, I don’t want to die here. Carry me out to 
the street, where the Mexican workers gather. I want to die in their midst, with 
my brothers, speaking to them of their rights as the producers of social wealth.” 
A little later the sweet child died without repenting that she had abandoned the 
comforts of a bourgeois life for the turbulent life full of the dangers and miseries 
of a true revolutionary. 
</p>

<p>
Margarita remained alone. Her daughter and comrade in struggle could 
no longer share the hardships, the worries, the miseries that are the reward of the 
sincere fighters. But this didn’t cause the noble sower of ideals to slacken in her 
work.With the comrade Natividad Cortes, she undertook to organize the revolu¬ 
tionary movement in the northern part of Sonora, having as a base of operations 
the little town of Sonoyta in that state.This occurred in October of last year. Both 
comrades worked with ardor, coming to an agreement with the comrades who 
resided on Mexican territory, when Rodolfo Gallegos, who this time was a partisan 
of Carranza and who was given the charge by his boss of watching the border, 
tripped over them by accident. Comrade Natividad Cortes was shot on the spot, 
and Margarita carried off as a prisoner to Baja California, where Gallegos ordered 
that she be left in a spot where she would certainly be seen and captured by the 
forces of Huerta, in this manner leaving to them the task of murdering her. 
</p>

<p>
Margarita was arrested on November 20 of the past year by the forces of 
Huerta, and put in jail with a guard standing watch.The felons who boast of being 
authorities went to pains to martyr her. She didn’t fear confessing that she was a 
member of the Partido Liberal Mexicano, and as such she fought the hydra with 
three heads: authority, capitalism, and the clergy. But she didn’t denounce any of 
the comrades who were in accord with her about launching the cry of Land and 
Liberty! in the northern part of the state of Sonora. Then they tortured her, as in 
the dark times of the Inquisition. Her cowardly torturers wanted to make her 
disclose the names of the comrades who were pledged to rebel. But all of their 
efforts shattered against the will of steel of that admirable woman.“Cowards!” she

<p>
disinherited. And for this reason they hated her; they hated her as those with 
vulgar hearts hate the noble and pure who stand in the way of their mean ambi¬ 
tions. 
</p>

<p>
Margarita had enough of a fortune that she could have lived an easy, lazy 
life; but she couldn’t enjoy that life while she knew that there were millions of 
human beings who struggled painfully to gain subsistence. With the energy that 
one finds only among persons with convictions, Margarita said in 1911 to her 
unconscious partner: “I love you, but I also love those who suffer; and I fight and 
risk my life for them. I don’t want to see any more men and women giving their 
energy, their health, their minds, their future to enrich the bourgeoisie. I don’t 
want men to command men any longer. I’m resolved to continue fighting for the 
cause of the Partido Liberal Mexicano, and if you’re a man, come with me to the 
battle. If that’s not the case, forget me; I don’t want to be the partner of a coward.” 
The persons who witnessed this scene affirm that the coward didn’t want to 
follow her. Then she turned to her daughter, Rosaura Gortari, speaking to her in 
these terms: “And you, my daughter?’’This heroine responded to the other: “And 
separate myself from you, mama? Never! Let’s saddle the horses and launch our¬ 
selves into the battle for the redemption of the working class! ” 
</p>

<p>
When Madero rose to power, Margarita and Rosaura were expelled from 
Mexicali on orders of Rodolfo Gallegos. In order to make the situation of the mar¬ 
tyrs more painful, Gallegos ordered that they march through the desert and its 
immense sand dunes under the scorching sun without water, without food, and 
on foot with the notice that if they returned to the town they’d be put in front of 
a firing squad. For several days the poor victims of the capitalist system dragged 
themselves through the sand dunes. Thirst devoured them; hunger made them 
weak. Not one traveler lent them aid; not one arroyo slaked their thirst. Rosaura 
weakened visibly, making Margarita’s situation even sadder. In the end, in spite of 
her extraordinary energy, Rosaura fainted, fell to the earth, and closed her eyes. 
Margarita believing that the daughter she loved with all her heart had died and, 
crazy with pain, tried to commit suicide. But when she put the gun to her head 
she saw that her daughter was looking at her and, overcome with emotion, ran in 
search of water to give to the stricken one. Fortunately, this time she found it. 
</p>

<p>
They arrived in Yuma, and there they were arrested by the immigration 
authorities. A woman like Margarita, an honor to humanity, a splendid example 
of the human race, couldn’t reside in this land of vulgarity and stupidity. For a 
person to be able to enter the United States, it’s necessary that they believe in 
law and authority. The libertarian Margarita, in accord with the imbecile laws of 
the U.S., couldn’t be admitted and was to be deported to Mexico.Thanks to the

MARGARITA ORTEGA 
</p>

<p>
Regeneracion, June 13, 1914 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
It’s difficult to follow pace by pace the actions of the comrades in Mexi¬ 
co who are working to channel the revolutionary movement toward communist 
anarchism. One can’t count on easy means of communication; the railroad lines 
are destroyed; the bridges have been blown up; the mountain passes are watched 
by the soldiers of Huerta, those of Carranza, the libertarians, the Zapatistas, or by 
armed members of other factions. Apart from all this, the contingencies of the 
struggle oblige the different combative forces to change positions, to cut the tele¬ 
graph lines, or to take refuge in the heart of the mountains and forests. 
</p>

<p>
For all of these reasons, the news arrives very late when it does arrive, 
since frequently the messengers are shot before they get to their destination, or 
are stopped in some other manner.There’s no reason to think it strange, therefore, 
that it’s taken us so long to confirm the death of the great anarchist who in life 
was known as Margarita Ortega. 
</p>

<p>
This extraordinary woman was a member of the Partido Liberal Mexi- 
cano, whose anarcho-communist ideals she propagated through word and action. 
In 1911, Margarita was the link between the combat forces of the Partido Liberal 
Mexicano in Baja California. An able horsewoman and an expert in the use of fire¬ 
arms, Margarita crossed the enemy lines and smuggled arms, munitions, dynamite, 
whatever was needed, to the comrades on the field of action. More than once 
her boldness and coolness saved her from falling into the clutches of the forces 
of tyranny. Margarita Ortega had a great heart: from her horse, or from behind a 
rock, she could shoot down a government soldier, and a little later one could see 
her caring for the wounded, feeding the convalescents, or providing words of 
consolation to the widows and orphans. Apostle, warrior, nurse—this exceptional 
woman was all of these simultaneously. She could never stand to see anyone suf¬ 
fer in her presence, and many will testify how she took a piece of bread from her 
own mouth in order to give it to the hungry. 
</p>

<p>
A woman of exquisite sentiments, she loved her family deeply; but her 
family was composed of unconscious people, of bourgeois persons and prole¬ 
tarians who aspired to be bourgeois, and they could never understand how a 
woman endowed with such extraordinary talent and such inexhaustible energy, 
and who possessed a substantial fortune, could make common cause with the

<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
While all the partisans of war deceive themselves by saying that the Unit¬ 
ed States fights for liberty, the judiciary committee of the senate is considering 
a law against espionage. This law, which will shortly be approved by congress, 
prohibits the criticism of what’s going on now, and only allows criticisms of past 
events. 
</p>

<p>
No one will be able to give his opinion of what’s occurring now. If the 
acts of the government are rash, those of a headless man, well, they’ll remain 
reckless, the acts of a headless man, because after they approve this law it’ll be a 
treasonous crime to think with your own head. 
</p>

<p>
This law also gives the postal general wide power to impede the circula¬ 
tion through the mails of anarchist periodicals. 
</p>

<p>
One couldn’t ask for greater freedom nor a greater spirit of justice. 
</p>

<p>
If an anarchist periodical denounces the war as a crime, as there can’t 
be a greater crime than the killing of human beings to maintain exploitation and 
tyranny, then this periodical will be denied all mailing privileges, its editors will be 
arrested, and if the government wishes they’ll be shot. 
</p>

<p>
In contrast, if a bourgeois periodical stirs up a war of proletarians against 
proletarians, to the benefit of privilege and tyranny, well then, this bourgeois pe¬ 
riodical, this fomenter of hatred between peoples, will be given full mailing privi¬ 
leges and its editors will be overwhelmed with honors and distinctions.

There is liberty, but only for lies and crime.

<p>
about any matter, a liberty fully conceded to all writers: to the socialist, to the free¬ 
thinker, to the Republican, to the Democrat, to the religious, to the prohibitionist, 
to everyone except the anarchist, which demonstrates that the famous political 
liberties, in the United States as in every other country on Earth, are a farce when 
one attempts to use the truth to show that the present system under which we 
humans suffer is evil, and that it’s necessary to overthrow it in order to build from 
the ground up a new one more in accord with liberty and justice. 
</p>

<p>
Comrades: the purpose of doing away with Regeneration can be clearly 
seen, the purpose of suppressing the periodical and throwing us in prison. It’s 
necessary to defend against this brutal assault on freedom of thought. It’s nec¬ 
essary that in these trying moments that we unite as a single man around the 
periodical. Two things are needed immediately, on the march, without delay: to 
protest and to collect funds to defend against the persecution. 
</p>

<p>
On the third page you’ll find a protest in both Spanish and English. Every¬ 
one who values the life of the periodical should sign it and send it to Woodrow 
Wilson in Washington, DC. 
</p>

<p>
To confront the persecution which draws near, send funds without wast¬ 
ing time, since we lack them. Remember that we’ve sacrificed everything in this 
long contest we’ve been sustaining and that we can’t count on anything other 
than the solidarity of honorable workers. 
</p>

<p>
Venustiano Carranza wants to cement his rule with the aid of the United 
States.This is why we’re being persecuted. Don’t permit such a government to be¬ 
come strong, because if this succeeds all will be lost that has been won through 
so much sacrifice. 
</p>

<p>
Help us!

<p>
One final circumstance has furthered the belief that someone is prepar¬ 
ing an accusation against Regeneration. Various comrades have received a circu¬ 
lar sent out by the postal inspector, W.M. Cookson, of the post office in this city, 
asking that they serve as witnesses against Regeneration. Some of the comrades 
have sent us these circulars. I have here a translation of said circular: 
</p>

<p>
Los Angeles, Cal. 
</p>

<p>
November 4, 1915 
</p>

<p>
Dear Sir: 
</p>

<p>
I am informed that you are a subscriber to Regeneration , a periodical 
published in Los Angeles. I would like to obtain from you two or three issues of 
this periodical, which have been sent to you by post during the month of October 
1915 or September 1915. 
</p>

<p>
Examples of this periodical are needed in the investigation of a matter 
being studied by the Post Office, and therefore I would appreciate it if you would 
send to me, in the enclosed return envelope, which does not need postage, the 
issues of Regeneration which you have received by post in the United States dur¬ 
ing the month of October 1915, issues which will be carefully preserved in order 
to be returned to you after they have been utilized for what is needed. 
</p>

<p>
In this matter, I would appreciate it if you would put your initials on ev¬ 
ery issue to identify it, as well as to certify that the periodical was received by you 
via regular post. 
</p>

<p>
Attached is a return envelope for the mailing of the issues, and I would 
appreciate it if you would act on my request as soon as you are able. 
</p>

<p>
From your attentive, faithful servant, 
</p>

<p>
Inspector W.M. Cookson 
</p>

<p>
As can be seen from this circular, the matter is serious. They are trying 
to bring charges against Regeneration , and for charges against a periodical to be 
admitted in court, it’s necessary to demonstrate that it’s circulated via the mails. 
The testimony that Regeneration is circulated via the mails is what the postal 
authorities want to obtain from our comrades. 
</p>

<p>
The charge against Regeneration must be founded in some writing that 
has appeared in the October issues, as can be deduced from Cookson’s circular. 
They’re trying, therefore, to violate one of our constitutional rights: that of writing 
</p>


<p>
CHAPTER SEVEN: POLITICAL REPRESSION ★ 223 
</p>




<p>
Naturally, those who have an interest in maintaining the present iniqui¬ 
tous system, because they could never obtain advantages under a system based 
on liberty, equality, and fraternity, are the most bitter enemies of Regeneration. 
</p>

<p>
Regeneration , despite everything that is said to the contrary,is a periodi¬ 
cal that exercises great influence within the Mexican revolutionary movement. 
This is why Diaz pursued it to the death in Mexico as in the United States, spend¬ 
ing around a million dollars to ensure that we were stopped by three years in 
prison, after being arrested in August 1907 until we were freed in August 1910. 
</p>

<p>
Later, Madero, spending a similar amount, managed to have us returned 
to prison from June 1912 to January 1914. 
</p>

<p>
Now that Carranza is the persecutor, another torrent of gold will be nec¬ 
essary to put us in prison under new charges. Of course, he has already begun to 
channel this gold which does not come from his own pockets, but rather from 
the sweat of the poor people who inhabit the part of Mexico dominated by his 
soldiers.These people, who yearn for their liberty, will be obligated to contribute 
to the buying of their own chains, or, what is the same thing, to the putting in 
prison of those who truly fight for their liberty. 
</p>

<p>
The influence that Regeneration exercises in Mexican affairs has been 
confessed by the most prominent politicians and businessmen in Mexico, and by 
the U.S. Senator Falls, based on the information he gathered during three years 
on the foreign aid received by the Mexican Revolution; he concluded that the 
Partido Liberal Mexicano and its organ, Regeneration, were responsible for the 
constant state of agitation in which the Mexican people have found themselves. 
</p>

<p>
Those interests which want to confuse the people deny that the aston¬ 
ishing progress of the Mexican Revolution over the past five years is due to the 
Partido Liberal Mexicano; and they deny that if principles of communist anar¬ 
chism triumph in Mexico it will be due to the Partido Liberal Mexicano and its 
organ, Regeneration. 
</p>

<p>
For several weeks we’ve noted an increase in the vigilance with which 
the authorities have watched us here, to the point where it’s not only the oc¬ 
casional isolated dog who spies on us, but the entire pack that watches us. If 
one adds to this the insistence with which the Carranzist periodicals have been 
accusing us of being the intellectual authors of the revolutionary movement of 
Mexicans in Texas, there is good reason to believe that a plot is being hatched 
against us, the purpose of which on the part of the United States is to aid Carranza 
in ridding himself of anyone who could stand in the way of his plans for consoli¬ 
dating his government.

<p>
WINDS OF THE TEMPEST 
</p>

<p>
Regeneracion, November 13, 1915 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
Regeneracion has always had the privilege of attracting a tempest, in the 
same manner as a summit attracts lightning.This is because Regeneracion is great, 
because Regeneracion is the summit, because Regeneracion is an eminence from 
whose heights the truth is spoken. 
</p>

<p>
And this is what causes pain: that the truth is spoken.The beautiful, grand, 
sweet truth for those who suffer; the same truth is horrible, is bitter for those who 
exploit and swindle.This is why the poor love truth and the tyrant hates and fears 
it. 
</p>

<p>
Regeneracion has always spoken the truth. For that truth, it has been 
crushed on more than one occasion by tyranny, its editors thrown into prison, its 
presses confiscated, its offices invaded, its archives seized. 
</p>

<p>
Once again the tempest announces itself. Something hatched itself in the 
shadows against the beloved periodical in which we’re growing old, for which we 
have sacrifice the pleasures that flourish in youth, for which we have offered the 
only wealth which the poor can possess: our health. 
</p>

<p>
The honest periodical, the enlightening periodical, the periodical that 
leads the way is going to be snatched from our hands and thrown into the mud 
without life, dead—the periodical that injects strength into the hearts of the sad; 
the periodical that puts a touch of roses into the minds darkened by misfortune; 
the periodical that as an arm holding aloft a torch in the darkness signals to the 
people the path that they should take. 
</p>

<p>
With its death, Regeneracion will carry away part of our lives, because in 
its columns we have emptied unmeasurable amounts of blood from our arteries, 
illumination from our minds, and in its cramped lines we have deposited huge 
amounts of energy, will, sincerity, and determination. 
</p>

<p>
Regeneracion is a periodical that, by its very nature, is always in danger of 
its life, not because it offends virtue and loves crime, but rather quite the contrary: 
because it educates, instructs, awakens enthusiasms that endanger the existence 
of a social, political and economic system that permits a few to do nothing useful 
and still enjoy all the good things in life, and that condemns the rest of humanity 
to fatigue, pain, slavery, and death.

ONCE AGAIN AT OUR POST 
</p>

<p>
Regeneration, January 13, 1914 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
After a forced absence we once again find ourselves free.We entered jail 
with our heads held high and we leave it with our heads held high, saying to all, 
friends and enemies: “Here we are! Here we are!” If the enemy believes that he 
has crushed us, it’s necessary to confess that the enemy has failed. Shackles tor¬ 
tured our flesh, but our will is whole and today we are the same men as always, 
tenacious rebels, enemies of injustice. 
</p>

<p>
Upon renewing our labors we send our cordial greetings to the op¬ 
pressed of the entire world and our defiance to the powerful of the world. For 
the oppressed we bring our love and our sympathy; for the powerful we bring 
damnation and a whip. 
</p>

<p>
Through means of these lines we wish to make know the affection we 
have for all of the comrades, both male and female, who with their monetary 
contributions or through their personal labors aided our comrades Teodoro M. 
Gaytan, Bias Lara, and P. Araujo in sustaining this periodical. 
</p>

<p>
Now we hope that all will continue their aid in the best manner possible 
to help ensure that the periodical of the oppressed will continue its propaganda 
work.The circumstances in which we’ve found the paper are truly terrible.The 
deficit has continued to grow week by week, though thanks to the heroic efforts 
of our comrades Gaytan, Lara,Araujo, Owen,Tellez and a few others we’ve found 
that our beloved periodical still has life. But we believe that it will be very difficult 
to prolong this life unless each and every one of our friends and sympathizers, 
men and women, make some sacrifices and undertake not only to save the life of 
Regeneration, but also to help the periodical reach a press run of at least 50,000 
copies weekly. 
</p>

<p>
Those who truly have a commitment to making the periodical live, those 
who understand the necessity of its publication, should make powerful efforts to 
sustain it. We are ready to suffer jail or assassination; we’ve sacrificed everything 
for the cause of the workers and hope that all of the poor, men and women alike, 
will make the sacrifice of dedicating a few centavos or pesos every time they can 
to sustain the paper. 
</p>

<p>
Now, to work with the same enthusiasm as before until victory or

Mexicans: the moment is solemn.The time to count ourselves has arrived: 
we are millions and the exploiters are only a few. Let us claim our brothers who 
are prisoners in Texas from the hands of bourgeois justice. We cannot permit that 
the hands of the hangman put the rope of the noose around those noble necks. 
Contribute money toward the defense of these martyrs; agitate to shift opinion in 
their favor. 
</p>

<p>
Enough with the crimes committed against persons of our race! The ash¬ 
es of Antonio Rodriguez haven’t even been spread by the wind yet; on the plains 
of Texas the blood of the Mexicans murdered by the white savages is still drying. 
Let us raise our arms to impede the new crime that the North American bourgeoi¬ 
sie is preparing against Rangel and his comrades. 
</p>

<p>
Mexicans: if you have blood in your veins, unite to save our prisoner 
brothers in Texas. By saving them you’ll save not only Rangel, Alzalde, Cisneros 
and the other workers, you’ll save yourselves, because your actions will earn you 
respect. Who of you hasn’t been the victim of an outrage in this country for the 
sole reason of being Mexican? Who of you hasn’t heard daily of crimes committed 
against our race? Don’t you know that in the south of this country that Mexicans 
are not permitted to sit by the side with North Americans in restaurants? Haven’t 
you entered a barbershop where you’ve been told, while they look you up and 
down, “We don’t serve Mexicans here”? Don’t you know that the prisons in the 
United States are full of Mexicans? And haven’t you even counted the number of 
Mexicans who have been lynched or burned alive by brutal mobs of whites? 
</p>

<p>
If you know all this, help in saving our racial brothers who are prisoners 
in Texas. Contribute with your money and with your minds to saving them. Let us 
agitate for them. Let us declare ourselves on strike for a day as a demonstration of 
protest against the persecution or those martyrs, and if protests and legal defenses 
don’t serve, if agitation and strikes don’t produce the desired effect of putting the 
fourteen prisoners at complete liberty, then rise up, rise up in arms against injus¬ 
tice with the barricade and dynamite. Let us count ourselves—we are millions.

tie between the revolutionary elements in southern and central Mexico and the 
elements that had remained pure in the north. You know well what the fortunes 
were of these workers: Juan Rincon and Silvestre Lomas fell dead after being 
shot by thugs employed by the state of Texas before reaching Mexico, and the 
rest, Rangel, Alzalde, Cisneros and eleven more find themselves prisoners in that 
state, some of them sentenced to long prison terms, others to life imprisonment, 
while Rangel, Alzalde, Cisneros and others are going to fall victim to the death 
penalty. All of these honest workers are innocent of the crime imputed to them. 
It happened that one night during their journey to Mexico a Texas sheriff named 
Candelario Ortiz died, and they dumped the responsibility onto the fourteen rev¬ 
olutionaries .Who witnessed the act? No one! Our comrades were found at a great 
distance from where the thug’s body was found. Nonetheless, they tried to throw 
the responsibility for the death of this dog of the capitalists upon them, for the 
simple reason that our prisoner brothers in Texas are poor and are rebels. It was 
enough that they were members of the working class and that they had the inten¬ 
tion of crossing the border to fight for the interests of their class, for North Ameri¬ 
can capitalism to pile on top of them trying to avenge the loss of its businesses 
in Mexico. If our comrades had been partisans of Villa or Carranza, if they had 
had the intention of going to Mexico to put a Villa or Carranza in the presidential 
seat, so that these men could direct business to the North Americans, nothing 
would have been done to them; on the contrary, the U.S. Authorities would have 
protected them. But as they are noble men who want to see the Mexican worker 
completely free, the U.S. bourgeoisie discharged its anger upon them and asked 
for the death penalty as a compensation for the losses to its businesses it’s suffer¬ 
ing in the proletarian revolution. 
</p>

<p>
In contrast, the murderers of Rincon and Lomas are free. The same U.S. 
bourgeoisie which asks for the death of Rangel and his comrades heaps honors 
and distinctions upon the felons who took the life of two honorable men. We 
have here, proletarians, bourgeois justice.The worker can die like a dog, but don’t 
touch the thug who did it! Here and everywhere the worker is of no value.Those 
who are valued are those who do nothing! The bees kill the drones that eat in 
the hive, but who don’t produce anything.The humans, less intelligent than the 
bees, kill the workers—who produce everything—so that the rich, the rulers, the 
cops, and the soldiers, who are the drones in the social hive, can live comfortably 
without producing anything useful. 
</p>

<p>
This is bourgeois justice.This is the accursed “justice” that we revolution¬ 
aries must destroy, let it pain whomever it pains, and let fall whomever will fall.

decimated the energetic inhabitants who refused to deliver to the rich the lands 
which gave them subsistence.

<p>
These experiences should serve to show you never to entrust to anyone 
the task of delivering your liberty and well-being. Learn from the noble proletar¬ 
ians of the south of Mexico. They do not aspire to elevate a new tyrant so that 
their hunger will be mitigated. Valiant and noble, they don’t ask; they take. Before 
the women and children who ask for bread, they don’t wait for a Carranza or a 
Villa to rise to the presidency and to give them what they need; rather, valiantly 
and nobly, with gun in hand, in the thunder of combat and the flashes of the in¬

They do not wait for a caudillo to rise up who will give them something 
to eat. Intelligent and dignified, they destroyed the titles to property, tore down 
the fences, and put their productive hands upon the earth.To ask is for cowards; 
to take is the work of men. #n our knees we can arrive at death, not life. Let us 
rise. 
</p>

<p>
Let us rise, and with the shovel that now serves to pile up gold for our 
masters, let us split their skulls in two, and with the sickle that weakly cuts off 
ears of corn, let us cut off the heads of the bourgeoisie and the tyrants. And above 
the smoldering embers of this damned system, let us plant our banner, the banner 
of the poor, to the cry of Land and Liberty! 
</p>

<p>
Let us no longer elevate anyone; let us ail rise! Let us no longer hang 
medals or crosses on the chests of our leaders; if they want to be decorated, let 
us decorate them with our fists. Whoever is an inch above us is a tyrant; let us 
topple him! The hour of justice has arrived, and in place of the ancient cry, the ter¬ 
ror of the rich,“Your money or your life!” let us substitute this cry:“Your money 
and your life!” Because if we leave a single member of the bourgeoisie alive, he 
will know how to arrange things so that sooner or later he’ll have his foot on our 
necks. 
</p>

<p>
To put into practice the ideals of supreme justice, the ideals of the Par- 
tido Liberal Mexicano, a group of workers began a march one day in the month of 
September last year in the state ofTexas.These men had a grand mission.The rev¬ 
olutionary movement of northern Mexico having been corrupted by the heads 
of the movement, they went overflowing with noble ideas to inject new energy 
into the spirit of rebellion that had quickly degenerated in this region into the 
spirit of discipline and subordination to leaders. These men went to establish a

<p>
U.S. forces in Veracruz to Mexico City is no other thing than a move in a military 
game that has for its entertaining object the tying up of the Mexican forces which 
oppose the invasion, while Carranza and Villa can advance with no real obstacles 
toward the heart of the country. Santa-Anna died, but he has been reincarnated in 
these two bandits: Carranza and Villa. These are the men who invite U.S. capital¬ 
ism to invade Mexico; these are the vultures who hope that American arms give 
the coup de grace to Mexican liberties, so that they can seat themselves and then 
devour the cadaver. 
</p>

<p>
Without the consent of Villa and Carranza, U.S. capitalism wouldn’t have 
dared to invade Mexican territory, and this lesson, like so many others, should 
serve to show the workers that they should entrust to no one the resolution of 
their affairs, because while the proletarians, deaf to the voice of reason, blind to 
the light of experience, entrust to one or a number of individuals the mission of 
giving them their liberty and of making them happy, the chains of slavery will 
continue to be their prize for their good faith and their trust. The proletarians 
who follow Carranza and Villa do not follow them, certainly, for the pleasure of 
changing bosses, nor to permit themselves the luxury of exchanging yokes, but 
in their simplicity they believe even yet that somebody can give them liberty and 
well-being, when, hear it well proletarians, liberty is not a thing to be given, but a 
conquest taken by the oppressed for themselves, and liberty, understand it well, 
cannot exist side by side with misery, but rather is a direct, logical, natural product 
of one thing: the satisfaction of all human needs, without depending on anyone to 
deliver them. 
</p>

<p>
A man is free, truly free, when he doesn’t need to rent out his arms to 
anyone in order to lift a piece of bread to his mouth, and this liberty is obtained 
solely in one manner: taking resolutely, without fear, the lands, the machinery, and 
the means of transport so that they will be the property of all, men and women 
alike. 
</p>

<p>
This will not be gained by elevating anyone to the presidency of the 
republic, because the government, whatever its form—republican or monarchi¬ 
cal—can never be on the side of the people.The government’s mission is to guard 
the interests of the rich. In thousands of years, there has not been a single case in 
which a government has put its hands upon the property of the rich to deliver it 
to the poor. On the contrary, wherever government has been seen and wherever 
it is seen, the government makes use of force to repress any attempt of the poor 
to better their situation. Remember Rio Blanco, remember Cananea, where the 
bullets from the government soldiers smothered in blood, in the throats of the

<p>
eyes of the international bourgeoisie and the governments of the world, one of 
the most stirring and sublime dramas in the history of the peoples of the world 
is unfolding in that beautiful country. There is being disputed, with guns in hand, 
the right of all human beings to live; there the workers tear to shreds the prop¬ 
erty titles of the rich, and showing to the astonished world, with their hands, 
what tradition and the law call sacrilege, they emit this heroic cry:“No more titles 
sanctioned by the law! From today forward, in order to live and enjoy the wealth, 
there will be no other titles to property than the calluses on the hands.” 
</p>

<p>
The international bourgeoisie and all governments fear that the spark 
which glows in Mexico will be the beginning of a formidable conflagration 
which, sooner or later, will turn the world into a single flame which will reduce 
the capitalist system to ashes when the worker puts down his tools, which serve 
only to enrich the owner, and takes up the banner of Land and Liberty. Because 
example is contagious, the hungry in the United States, the French outcast, the 
Russian slave, the British serf, the disinherited of all countries could take a lesson 
from their brother, the Mexican worker and, undertaking on their own count that 
task of winning their liberty and well-being, could apply the torch and dynamite 
to political and monetary power, which is the only means left to the poor man to 
rid himself of his exploiters. 
</p>

<p>
Fear and greed were the trembling hands which brought the stars and 
stripes to Mexico.The fear of the oppressors and exploiters of the entire world is 
that their respective flocks will imitate the Mexican worker and will wave, in ev¬ 
ery land, the red banner of Land and Liberty.The tear is that the Mexican worker, 
having taken possession of the land, and free by that sole act, will refuse to rent 
his arms to enrich the parasites. The U.S. forces did not come to Mexico in the 
name of civilization and benevolence; these forces came to murder Mexicans to 
benefit the bandits of finance and the principle of authority. These forces have 
been pushed by capitalism to kill the workers who don’t want bosses, who want 
to be free, who no longer supplicate, who do not ask anymore, and who, resolved, 
noble, and virile, pluck from the chest of the rich the black heart that never con¬ 
tracted when faced with the pain of the humble. 
</p>

<p>
Such is the motive for the intervention, and on this black page of inter¬ 
national politics, like the serpent that slithers noiselessly through the weeds to 
strike the heel of his victim, two reptiles drag themselves, two reptiles who it will 
eventually be necessary to crush: Villa and Carranza, two sons of Judas. The plan 
forged in the shadows is simple: with the aid of the U.S. forces,Villa and Carranza 
will be able to arrive in Mexico City, seat themselves in power, and deliver the 
Mexican worker, tied hand and foot, to capitalist exploitation.The threat from the

<p>
THE INTERVENTION AND THE PRISONERS OF TEXAS 
</p>

<p>
Speech, May 31, 1914 
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
Let my words resound as a condemnation of the powerful of the Earth; 
let my words rise angrily and fearlessly to announce to the exploiters of the peo¬ 
ple that there is a will greater than that of the tyrants, that there is a force more 
powerful than the fist of the despot, and that this will and this force reside in us, 
those on the bottom, among those contemptuously dismissed by those who ex¬ 
ploit us, among those who with our arms and intelligence construct the buildings 
and with our sweat and blood cultivate the fields, maintain the railways, drill the 
tunnels, draw the useful minerals from the bosom of the Earth, and who, when 
hopelessness fills our breasts, with the same hands that create the wealth, will 
raise the barricade and fire the gun. 
</p>

<p>
The necessities of the moment are truth and valor. It is necessary to 
speak the truth, whatever the cost. If U.S. forces have planted the stars and stripes 
on the coast of Mexico, it hasn’t been to satisfy a worthy desire for benevolence 
and justice. This banner has been planted in Veracruz like a dagger in the breast 
of justice; this banner did not appear on those beaches as a luminous symbol of 
civilization and culture, but as the black rag that covers the face of crime while it 
empties the pockets of its victim.This banner is the mask of all the great bandits 
of industry, commerce, and finance of all countries whose interest it is that the 
Mexican worker remain a slave. This banner is the knife and the whip, the chain 
and the noose. It doesn’t shine as an insignia of redemption and progress; rather, 
it floats in the breeze like a shroud blown in the night by the winds of death. 
</p>

<p>
What noble impulse impelled this rag to land on the beaches of Mexico? 
What friendly breeze dragged it toward these lands? What noble idea is represent¬ 
ed by it, flying above a city taken by surprise? Fear and greed: this is what is at the 
bottom of this farce which will end in tragedy—the fear that all the oppressors 
and all the exploiters of humanity feel before the unmistakable awakening of the 
enslaved masses who struggle to break their chains. If the Mexican Revolution 
were a movement which had as its object the unseating of a president in order to 
put another in his place, the exploiters of the people would laugh, because such a 
movement wouldn’t threaten them, because the social system that allows them to 
become rich and powerful at the expense of the suffering of the workers would 
remain intact. But this is not what is occurring in Mexico. Before the frightened

These are not, then, bandits, these workers rising up in arms in Texas, but 
rather revolutionaries who, as they themselves say, “fight for the economic and 
social emancipation of the universal proletariat.” 
</p>

<p>
Let the bourgeois press, then, stop its lying. The truth is not to be feared; 
what is to be feared is the lie.

<p>
“Mexicans: Live to be free, or die for allowing yourselves to be slaves!” 
</p>


<p>
Bandits don’t express themselves in such a manner. They don’t express 
themselves in the manner of those who sent us the flyer we’ve just reproduced. 
Bandits do not harbor in their hearts desires for human redemption, as do those 
who wrote this flyer, in which is advocated the creation of a single human family 
composed of the working class and, to use their words, “the universal family in 
which reigns peace and justice.” 
</p>

<p>
It can be seen that the revolutionaries of Texas are not animated by race 
hatred. On the contrary, they want “the universal family.” 
</p>

<p>
Nor do bandits dream of working, while these men don’t desire anything 
other than to work, as can be seen in the paragraph in which they say:“take the 
lands that a few have in their power and put them in the hands of those who 
work them, that is the campesino who day after day waters the furrow for a little 
bad food to eat.”

“Brothers and sisters, read this and reflect.

<p>
“We the people, we who work the lands, are those who produce every¬ 
thing and possess nothing, not even what is indispensable for the sustenance of 
our beloved families, which is bread. 
</p>

<p>
“Because of this, we are convinced that it is cowardice to live in this 
world of misery and pain, misery and pain caused by the thieves who steal our la¬ 
bor, that is the rich. In order to end this, today we launch ourselves into an armed 
struggle, waving the red flag which is the symbol of the disinherited, of those who 
suffer in the fields, workshops, and mines. 
</p>

<p>
“We take this step, which is to go toward a life in pursuit of progress, a life 
in which every man with a good heart should desire to live in a society in which 
everyone works according to their abilities and receives according to their needs, 
and to make this a fact. It’s necessary to destroy capitalist society, which is based 
on crime and theft, and once it’s destroyed build the new society upon its ruins, 
with the entire working class forming a single family, the universal family, in which 
peace and justice reign. 
</p>

<p>

ing with arms in hand and putting the flaming torch to everything which is based 
upon the exploitation of man by man.

CHAPTER SIX: RACISM ★ 209

<p>
and then the representatives of authority commenced a veritable orgy of blood¬ 
shed. The Mexicans who fell into the grasp of the thugs were killed without any 
proof that they had taken part in the uprising. Hundreds of innocent persons of 
the Mexican race died—men, women, old people, children. Mexicans were killed 
wherever they were found. Such actions of authority provoked many Mexicans to 
rise in arms, some in order not to die without taking someone with them, some 
pushed by indignation over the injustice. Comrade Aniceto Pizana, who appears 
up till now to be the most notable figure in the movement, found himself sur¬ 
prised in his house by a gang of thugs who assaulted him for the sole fact of being 
Mexican. Pizana, as an anarchist, didn’t appreciate this outrage, and in union with 
three comrades from the vicinity resisted the brutal attack, in which Aniceto’s 
only son, who is only eleven years old, lost a leg. In the struggle several thugs lost 
their lives, andAniceto and his three comrades found themselves in the dilemma 
of either delivering themselves to the fury of bourgeois law or of declaring them¬ 
selves in open rebellion.They preferred the second alternative, and they joined to 
the revolutionary movement that which carries great force: the anarchist idea. 
</p>

<p>
This occurred on the third of August. Since then to date, the revolution¬ 
ary movement has attained great size judging from troop movements in this part 
of the country, movements which are not carried out as a mere pastime, but 
which have to be motivated by the presence of armed bands of Mexicans from 
various parts of the district affected by the revolution; and this belief is fortified 
by seeing in the bourgeois dailies the news of encounters between revolutionar¬ 
ies and soldiers from the U.S. Army in various places. 
</p>

<p>
The movement in Texas is a true economic and social movement. Born 
in a common incident, a transcendent movement has been developing for the 
last three months. This movement is now considered so important that General 
Funston has had to ask for considerable reinforcements in order to suffocate it. 
</p>

<p>
The bourgeois periodicals call the proletarians in arms bandits, but the 
facts demonstrate that they are not bandits. There are still no accounts of these 
men committing attacks on defenseless people. No. They are not bandits; they 
are men; they are revolutionaries; and we have the proof of this in the following 
leaflet which we received by mail from Texas. The following document—which 
we publish to demolish the lies of the bourgeois press, and to allow the public to 
know what is really going on in that state—says this: 
</p>

<p>
“To arms, Mexicans!

<p>
anyone other than those with an interest in hiding it, and this interest cannot be 
honorable, because honor is the twin sister of truth; they are inseparable: where 
there is truth, there is honor; where there is honor there must be truth. 
</p>

<p>
The bourgeois press has the habit of hiding the truth; the truth is light, 
and there are certain businesses that can only prosper in the darkness.That invet¬ 
erate camouflager of crime, the bourgeois press, has to hide the truth. That is its 
business! 
</p>

<p>
The bourgeois press along the border, from the Los Angeles Times to 
the insipid bourgeois Mexican periodicals that abound in the southwest of the 
United States, when referring to the uprisings that for three months have shaken 
the southern part of Texas, has not had more than a single preoccupation: hid¬ 
ing the truth, distorting the facts, calling us the authors—at least the intellectual 
authors—of the Mexican proletarian revolt in Texas. This can be seen in their 
writings, in the speed with which they denounced us as being, with no justifi¬ 
cation whatsoever, responsible for what occurred in Texas. In the revolution in 
Texas there are anarchists, comrades of ours, but they don’t obey any leadership, 
because if they did so they’d cease to be anarchists. 
</p>

<p>
We are likewise accused of having printed several proclamations that 
those revolutionaries have circulated, apparently in profusion, urging the Mexican 
workers to rise up in arms; and corresponding to the excitement in the bourgeois 
press, the authorities sent their agents marauding through the humble shacks in 
which we have our offices to see if they could discover anything. For the past 
month, thugs of all descriptions have come to poke their snouts into this corner 
of the city, which was formerly very peaceful. On any pretext they’ve come near 
to our place of work to see what we were doing. 
</p>

<p>
In respect to the revolution in Texas, the bourgeois press continues to 
insist upon treating it as a racial clash, whose principal objective is to kill whites 
and to carry the war forward until the vast territory that Mexico lost in 1847 will 
return once again to Mexican sovereignty. 
</p>

<p>
The origin of the revolutionary movement, as we mentioned in the Octo¬ 
ber 2 issue of Regeneration, was a common quarrel in a place near Brownsville 
between an American and a Mexican.The Mexican was treacherously killed by the 
American, and then several Mexicans avenged the victim by killing the American. 
The authorities persecuted the avengers, who took up guns rather than be taken 
with their arms folded. Others, being in misery and seeing an opportunity to win 
bread through violence, rallied to these men. Then occurred the first clashes be¬ 
tween the pursuers and the pursued, in which some of the American thugs died,

<p>
in San Antonio,Texas, La Prensa [“The Press”].The Los Angeles correspondent 
for that paper says in an article dated September 30: “The agents of Carranza in 
this city, acting under orders received directly from Veracruz, have for the last few 
days been undertaking a secret assignment, and have ended up making an accusa¬ 
tion against the well known Mexican socialist Flores Magon, who has taken root 
here form some time; these agents say that ‘he is the intellectual author of the 
disturbances which have been occurring along the Texas border for the past two 
months.’” 
</p>

<p>
What is true in this will be seen later. Carranza simply wants that we be 
hung, this being the penalty of the prostituted law that applies to those who rebel 
against the state. 
</p>

<p>
We are tranquil. We know that our activity, our dedication, our rebellion 
disgust those who tyrannize and exploit, and that they will not lack a pretext 
to throw us to the bottom of a dungeon or onto the steps of a gallows. We fear 
nothing, however. Before suffering humanity, we have promised to be loyal to 
the cause of the oppressed of the Earth. And well continue to be loyal until we 
exhale our final breath. All this we have resisted in our hazardous lives as unshak¬ 
able rebels, and well continue resisting it: misery, exhaustion, prison, and death. 
Onward! 
</p>

<p>
We give this notice, so that our brothers in chains will not be alarmed 
when they see us in the claws of authority; we give this notice so that no one will 
be discouraged, so that all will continue onward. If we are persecuted, we do not 
want discouragement to spread, but rather that with doubled vigor all proceed 
with the great work undertaken until the goal is achieved: the death of the capi¬ 
talist system.

presume that their information is incomplete, and that the number of the victims 
of authority is higher. 
</p>

<p>
I have here how El Presente refers to the victims of the rangers:“Nobody 
knows who killed the men who show up hung from the trees or riddled with 
shots; but the entire world points at the rangers.” 
</p>

<p>
And it adds:“Men have been killed hiding under their beds, and they have 
been killed inside their houses, in spite of having asked for a moment of peace to 
explain themselves.They have been taken to the jail to be hung, and even more 
have been shot in the back after giving up their arms and surrendering.” 
</p>

<p>
Shot in the back after they’ve surrendered! What better proof of a felony 
can be demanded against a ranger? 
</p>

<p>
This, in grand strokes, is what has occurred in Texas. It’s not a movement 
of bandits, as the bourgeois press tries to make it appear, but rather a natural 
movement of men who see their existence threatened and who defend them¬ 
selves as best they can. 
</p>

<p>
Justice, not gunshots, is what should be given to the revolutionaries in 
Texas. And, of course, everyone should demand that these persecutions of inno¬ 
cent Mexicans should cease and, in regard to the revolutionaries, we should also 
demand that they not be shot. 
</p>

<p>
Those who should be shot are the rangers and the mob of bandits who 
accompany them on their depredations.

THE UPRISINGS IN TEXAS (2) 
</p>

<p>
Regeneration, October 9,1915

<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
The uprisings of Mexicans in the state of Texas, uprisings which accord¬ 
ing to the news in the bourgeois press the militia has not been able to suppress, 
are giving an opportunity to our enemies to attribute to us participation in them. 
The papers that support Carranza openly accuse us of being the intellectual direc¬ 
tors of the revolt, with the perverse goal of throwing us to the dogs of authority. 
</p>

<p>
It appears that the infamous labors of the Carranzistas are having some 
effect, as can be seen in the lines which we’ll quote in a second from the paper 
</p>


<p>
CHAPTER SIX: RACISM ★ 205 
</p>




<p>
the leg. Since then, Aniceto has found himself under arms and, according to the 
bourgeois press, his revolutionary activity is intense. 
</p>

<p>
The case of Aniceto is not an isolated instance.The same occurred in oth¬ 
er places in the Brownsville region. These reckless acts were carried out by the 
representatives of authority upon persons who perhaps had never even thought 
of rebelling, but who were impelled by circumstances to take up arms to defend 
themselves against the invasive savages in order to save their own lives and those 
of their families, or even to have the satisfaction of exchanging a laborious and 
honorable life for the criminal life of a ranger, a cop, or a vigilante of the savage 
state of Texas. 
</p>

<p>
We have here the manner in which the spark of rebellion was blown 
into flames, and that which commenced as the vulgar persecution of a handful 
of individuals has been transformed through the stupidity of authority into a true 
revolution.There is no “ Plan of San Diego” nor any other such hoax; what we have 
is a legitimate movement of self-defense of the oppressed against the oppressor. 
</p>

<p>
Those who have taken up arms are not bandits, as they are labeled by 
the bourgeois press, but rather men who having found no protection in authority 
reach for the rifle.These are men who prefer to sell their lives dearly rather than 
allow themselves to be killed like lambs by bandits with neither conscience nor 
honor. 
</p>

<p>
The crimes committed by the rangers in these last two months, and par¬ 
ticularly in these last weeks, would rub the nerves raw of the most phlegmatic 
man. 
</p>

<p>
Hundreds of innocent Mexicans have been killed by these savages, with 
the victims including men, old people, women, and children.The houses of Mexi¬ 
cans have been burned, their fields destroyed, and these attacks have contributed 
to the spreading of the revolutionary movement. The Los Angeles Tribune says, in 
its edition of September 8, referring to the zone enveloped by the revolution in 
Texas, “&#x2026; A territory as large as the state of Illinois is seized by fear of midnight 
assaults, the burning of ranches, and death.” 
</p>

<p>
In another part of the same edition, it says:“More than five hundred Mexi¬ 
cans have been killed in the Rio Grande area over the past three weeks according 
to information given by the ‘rangers’ this day—September 7—to police officials 
in the counties affected by the revolution.” 
</p>

<p>
This is what the rangers confess; but knowing the criminal instinct of 
the vicious beasts that inhabit the police bodies in the state of Texas, one can

<p>
ting the work they wanted.They found in the attitude of the rebels a good oppor¬ 
tunity to snatch from the hands of the capitalists that which the capitalists deny 
to the poor: a piece of bread for themselves and their families. 
</p>

<p>
Naturally, these rebels were the victims of a ferocious persecution, be¬ 
cause the grand dame Authority is intransigent and ferocious to such an extent 
that rather than procuring peace among men, her criminal acts incite them to 
war. Instead of approaching these men and politely attempting to calm them by 
guaranteeing their being left in peace and freedom, her representatives, these bar¬ 
barians called “rangers,” a type of rural police in the border region with Mexico, 
opened fire on the rebels as soon as they had them in view. The rebels shot back, 
and this was the commencement of the state of war in which that portion of the 
United States found itself. 
</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, the struggle still could have been confined to the fight be¬ 
tween the rangers and the original rebels. But authority is not a shield nor a shel¬ 
ter for the poor, but rather a scourge, and therefore rather than protecting the 
poor inhabitants of the region in which authority was persecuting the rebels, it 
commenced to antagonize them in a thousand ways, pretending to find a rebel in 
every male Mexican the thugs stumbled upon; and then commenced an infamous 
hunt of Mexicans by the rangers. The rangers, reinforced by civilians, groups of 
cops, and inhuman types of all descriptions, entered en masse into the humble 
houses of the Mexicans (but not into the houses of the bourgeoisie, for which 
authority is the guard dog) and there delivered themselves into a veritable can¬ 
nibalistic saturnalia, shooting old men, women, and children, attempting to avenge 
themselves upon the innocent for the casualties inflicted upon them in open 
battle by the rebels. 
</p>

<p>
One of many such invaded houses belonged to the comrade Aniceto 
Pizana, an honorable man who resided in his dwelling on the de losTullvos ranch 
in the jurisdiction of Brownsville. The house was assaulted by a mob of savages 
representing authority on August 3, with the invaders discharging their weapons 
upon the inhabitants without respect of sex or age. Aniceto is not a man who 
will allow others to trample him, and with three other comrades who at the time 
were in his house returned the fire of the rangers, who numbered thirty-five. A 
vicious fight followed. Our four comrades made prodigious, valorous efforts, and 
the assaulters found themselves pinned down, and despite the thugs’great advan¬ 
tage, our heroic comrades held them at bay for over half an hour, shooting some 
dead and wounding some. Unfortunately, one of Aniceto’s children was wounded 
in the leg by one of the bandits, and there was no remedy other than amputating

<p>
THE UPRISINGS IN TEXAS 
</p>

<p>
Regeneration, October 2, 1915 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
Several weeks ago the bourgeois press was reporting on the clashes be¬ 
tween Mexicans and the forces of the United States in the territories that comprise 
the Texas counties of Hidalgo, Cameron, Starr, and others neighboring them. 
</p>

<p>
As is natural, the cause of this contest is hidden. Some wish to spread 
the belief that the uprisings of Mexicans in that portion of the United States was 
due to an agreement among Mexicans to bring to a head the Plan of San Diego, 
which advocates for the independence of the vast territory that the United States 
snatched from Mexico in the middle of the last century. But time passes and the 
true cause of this movement is appearing. 
</p>

<p>
It’s not the desire to put under the control of Mexico the U.S. territory 
that comprises the states of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, California, and 
parts of some others, which has impelled the Mexican residents ofTexas to rise in 
arms against the authorities of the United States, but something very different: the 
desire to defend themselves against the attacks of which members of our race are 
so often victims in this country. 
</p>

<p>
I have here the explanation of the origin of the uprisings from the 
bourgeois paper, El Presente , of San Antonio,Texas: “The origin of the revolt can 
be found in the following events. A Mexican was dancing in a little town near 
Brownsville, and an American wanted to snatch his woman away from him. The 
Mexican refused, and upon going out to the street was treacherously shot by the 
American.The Mexicans immediately avenged the death of their countryman, and 
then returned to the town, already armed and disposed to defend themselves 
from lynching or hanging. The precarious [economic] situation of several men 
made them see in this an opportunity for an armed uprising, and they took it, in 
order to take what they needed to live in this violent form.” 
</p>

<p>
How different this is from the lies propagated in the rest of the bourgeois 
</p>

<p>
press! 
</p>

<p>
As can be seen, the movement in Texas commenced with the rebellion 
of a handful of men who didn’t want to be the victims of the rampant injustice 
which afflicts our race in that state, and this handful was joined by all those tired 
of offering their arms to the bourgeoisie to be exploited, and then not even get-

<p>
Similarly, these papers report that dynamite bombs were thrown toward 
the residence of the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico. Again, these reports are un¬ 
founded. 
</p>

<p>
On Wednesday the multitude invaded the building where the lowest, 
most abject paper published in Mexico —El Impartial —is edited, and undertook 
the task of destroying the shop.The mounted police arrived, and with machete 
blows dispersed the demonstrators, with one of them succumbing to a saber 
slash from one of the cossacks. 
</p>

<p>
On Wednesday, more notable things happened: troops fired upon dem¬ 
onstrators, resulting in men being killed.When they were dispersed in one place, 
though, the demonstrators reunited in another.This happened repeatedly.There 
were many encounters between the thugs and the people. 
</p>

<p>
The protest of the residents of Mexico City resonated in Guadalajara, 
where students also organized a protest demonstration. For several hours the 
multitudes were the rulers of the city. Many U.S. businesses were stoned. The 
entire garrison was put under arms, and after several clashes between troops and 
demonstrators the crowds were dispersed. 
</p>

<p>
The government of Diaz, with its customary barbarity, had more than 
a hundred students arrested in Mexico City; it also gave definitive orders to the 
police and soldiery to ferociously repress any cry of protest, and reacting to the 
protests from the White House, has given forth explanations, promises of satisfac¬ 
tion, and promises to suppress all of the papers that, in virtue of having published 
articles protesting the lynching of Rodriguez, excited the public to demonstrate 
its disgust. 
</p>

<p>
This is all that is known as Regeneration goes to press. The Catholic 
periodical El Pats [“The Country”] recommends a boycott of U.S. products as a 
protest. Other periodicals are publishing articles energetically denouncing the 
crimes of which Mexicans are the object in this country; but none of them dare to 
speak the truth; none of them will open their lips to say that it is capitalism—the 
voracious octopus that sucks the life of the people—that is the cause of all of 
these disturbances, of all of these crimes, because capitalism foments racial ha¬ 
tred so that the peoples never come to understand each other, and so it reigns 
over them. 
</p>

<p>
order that they exploit for their own sole benefit the riches of the Mexican lands 
and seas, and in order that they function as authorities, in almost every case more 
brutal than native authorities. All of this has come to raise even higher the barrier 
that capitalism has put between the two races; all of this has made more difficult 
the task undertaken by the libertarians of the world, through our acts and our 
propaganda, of building fraternity and love among all the races of the world. 
</p>

<p>
That’s the way things are. And when the Mexican people see in the North 
American plutocracy the worst enemy of their liberty; when they realize that all 
of the persecutions and tortures we’ve been subjected to in this country are the 
result of the desires of the great U.S. millionaires that the conditions of tyranny 
and barbarism continue in Mexico, conditions that make possible the rapid en¬ 
richment of the very worst of men; when they see the way things are, we say, it 
won’t take more than a single event to set off a storm of protest—and the event 
that produced an explosion of indignation, as reported in the daily papers of this 
city, took place upon the savage plains of Texas, and its perpetrators were a mob 
of white savages who viciously targeted a humble Mexican.This Mexican,Antonio 
Rodriguez—accused of murdering a white woman, but who was never tried for 
it—was tied to a post by a horde of white North Americans and burned alive.This 
horrifying crime took place in Rock Springs,Texas on the third day of this month 
[November 1910]. 
</p>

<p>
Students in Mexico City organized a protest against this lynching, and it 
took place on the night of Tuesday the 8th. A great multitude gathered; there were 
fiery speeches denouncing this outrage. A large group of demonstrators went to 
the offices of the U.S. periodical, The Mexican Herald , which as is well known 
is supported by Diaz and which is one of the principal adulators that the despot 
counts on.The demonstrators smashed the building’s windows into pieces with 
rocks. 
</p>

<p>
On the following day, Wednesday, the students, followed by an immense 
multitude, roamed through the main streets of the city crying out against the mur¬ 
ders of which Mexicans are victims in Texas. Various businesses ended up with 
their windows broken. A U.S. flag was seized by the multitude and torn to pieces 
amidst cries of indignation against the crimes committed against Mexicans in this 
country. 
</p>

<p>
The papers also report that a North American was lynched and a North 
American child beheaded, but there is no proof of this, and it all boils down to the 
desire of these papers to attract readers through sensationalism.

that interventionist expeditions depart from the ports of the United States to 
overthrow, to make “revolution” against, those Latin American governments that 
refuse to submit to the demands of U.S. capitalism? Isn’t it public knowledge that 
the revolution against President Zelaya of Nicaragua was the work of North Amer¬

the Mexican people remember that they shed their blood combating the U.S. 
plutocracy due to the ambitions of the rich toward the lands of Mexico? [in the 
Mexican-American War of 1846-1847, in which the U.S. seized half of Mexico’s

<p>
These are facts which speak eloquently.These are facts which are in the 
memories of all, facts whose origins lie in the insatiable thirst for riches of the 
great U.S. millionaires, and facts which have come to raise a great wall between 
the two peoples of this beautiful hemisphere: a wall which would continue to 
stand erect, insurmountable, and which would end up turning into bitter enemies 
two important factions of humanity if the propaganda of the libertarians hadn’t 
fired the sentiments of love and fraternity in the hearts of all races, sentiments 
that when they flare up will bring down this barrier raised by the crimes of capi¬ 
talism, making of all the interests of one: beautiful, grand solidarity. 
</p>

<p>
In Mexico, especially—there’s no use in denying it—there exists a very 
marked hostility toward the absorptionist tendency of the U.S. government, a 
sentiment which day by day deepens because of the individual or collective ac¬ 
tions of the North Americans against the Mexicans who reside in this nation. 
Everyone knows the contempt with which Mexicans in general are treated; ev¬ 
eryone knows that in Texas Mexicans are treated worse than blacks. Mexicans 
are not admitted to hotels, restaurants, and other public establishments in Texas. 
The public schools close their doors to children of our race. North American 
semi-savages take target practice on Mexicans. How many men of our race have 
died because a white-skinned savage decided to prove his ability with firearms by 
shooting at us?—and without having any dispute with us! In the so-called courts 
of justice, Mexicans are judged, generally without bothering with legal formali¬ 
ties, and are sentenced to hang or to suffer other horrendous penalties without 
there being proof, or even the suspicion, that they actually committed the crimes 
for which they are sentenced. All of this is added to the arrogance shown by the 
U.S. rich who consider our unfortunate country a conquered country, because 
the cowardly and traitorous tyrant who oppresses us gives them everything that 
they want; he concedes everything on their demand, puts them in possession of 
cultivated lands that were possessed by humble laborers—because it’s always 
the poor who suffer; he gives them ample authority to cut down our forests, in

<p>
THE REPERCUSSIONS OF A LYNCHING 
</p>

<p>
Regeneration, November 12, 1910 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
The daily papers in this city have occupied themselves over these last 
few days telling their readers about the outrages inflicted upon U.S. citizens by 
rebellious mobs in Mexico City The stories told by the press are really hair-raising; 
but we believe that they are greatly exaggerated. 
</p>

<p>
One can’t deny that there is a reaction against U.S. imperialism in all of 
the Latin American countries; the reason for this is that imperialism is a grave 
threat to the lives of the Latin countries as autonomous nations. There is a senti¬ 
ment of hostility in our countries, one that is more marked every day, against the 
engulf-and-devour politics of the U.S. government. 
</p>

<p>
The reason is not the North American people, but rather the greed of the 
great U.S. millionaires—the thirst for gold of the plutocracy of this country has 
been the origin of this hostile sentiment which makes slow and hard the achieve¬ 
ment of fraternal relations among the human beings who populate this conti¬ 
nent, because while those of us who have liberated ourselves of racial prejudice 
work toward creating fraternal ties among all human beings, the millionaires, the 
big businessmen, the financial bandits, manage through their acts to divide the 
peoples, to open abysses between the diverse races and nationalities, and in this 
manner to ensure their empire. “Divide and conquer,” says Machiavelli. 
</p>

<p>
The attacks suffered by the peoples of Latin America have been moti¬ 
vated by the ambitions of the great millionaires, who use patriotism as a vehicle 
to commit outrages upon peoples who have committed no crime other than to 
live upon rich lands which have tempted the greed of Wall Street. Who doesn’t 
recall the attack on its sovereignty suffered by Colombia? [This refers to Teddy 
Roosevelt’s fomenting a “revolution” to split Panama off from Columbia so as to 
be able to build the Panama Canal.] Who has forgotten the intrigues of the great 
millionaires of this country against the independence of Venezuela? For whom 
is it a mystery that the politics of the White House toward Latin America is a 
politics of absorption, and a politics which tends, moreover, to support the most 
unbridled tyrannies, such as that of Porfirio Diaz in Mexico? And who doubts now 
that wherever there appears a government that doesn’t submit to the shameful 
tutelage of the U.S. plutocracy, sooner or later it will see itself subjected to re¬ 
volts shaped, directed, and fomented by rich North Americans? Who now doubts

those he comes near to, perhaps because they might rent themselves to the rich 
for a lower price than he would If there’s a strike, there’s no lack of the hungry 
dispossessed who will betray their class brothers, taking the places of the strikers. 
In this way of things, fraternity is a dream, and in its place we find only the hatred 
of one class for another; the hatred of the individuals in one class for each other; 
the frightening war of all against all that dishonors the human race and delays the 
coming of the day of love and justice of which noble men dream throughout the 
world. 
</p>

<p>
The revolution will break out. Everyone, those who choose to struggle in 
it and those who don’t, will be dragged along by the great movement. No one will 
be able to remain indifferent to the great clash. It is necessary, then, to choose a 
banner. If one desires simply a change of bosses, there are parties other than the 
Partido Liberal that will struggle solely to install new presidents and vice-presi¬ 
dents. But those who desire a genuine revolution, a deep,great revolution that will 
benefit the poor, will come to our files and gather together under the equalitarian 
banner of the Partido Liberal Mexicano; and, united, we will yank the land from 
the few hands that now grasp it and deliver it to the people; and we will come 
closer to the ideal of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity via the well-being of all.

<p>
classes, the same holds true politically. The judges rule in favor of the rich and 
against the poor when they hand down their decisions; the exercise of the right 
to vote is always directed, organized, and carried to a head by the dominant class¬ 
es, because they have the time for it, leaving to the poor only the “right” to carry 
their ballots to the ballot boxes with the name marked of someone chosen by 
those who have organized and directed the election. This results in the workers 
electing whomever the ruling class wants them to elect. The right of free expres¬ 
sion cannot be exercised by the poor, because they haven’t been able to acquire 
the necessary facility in writing or public speaking, so this right is taken advan¬ 
tage of, almost exclusively, by the dominant classes. And if one would compile a 
list of all political rights, one would eventually arrive at the conclusion that the 
poor cannot exercise these rights because their slave jobs leave them only the 
time absolutely necessary to rest themselves in their short hours of sleep. They 
don’t have the social presence provided by education; they don’t have economic 
independence; they don’t even dress well; and they lack the polish to compete 
well with the smoke-blowing bourgeois intellectuals. 
</p>

<p>
Fraternity! What fraternity can exist between the wolf and the lamb? So¬ 
cial inequality makes natural enemies of the different social classes. The possess¬ 
ors cannot harbor friendly sentiments toward the dispossessed, in whom they 
see a constant threat to their enjoyment of their riches; and likewise the poor 
cannot harbor fraternal feelings toward those who oppress them and who enjoy 
the fruits of their labors. From this grows a constant antagonism, an interminable 
dispute, a hidden struggle—and at times an open and decisive struggle—between 
the two social classes, a struggle which gives life and force to hateful sentiments, 
to desires for revenge that are not appropriate to the creation of fraternal ties and 
real friendship, things which are impossible between a thug and his victim. But 
that’s not all. There’s even more today that impedes human beings from becom¬ 
ing closer, opening their hearts to their brothers.The struggle for life, even though 
it’s shameful to admit it, reveals in the human species the same brutal and wild 
characteristics as in the lower animals. As long as the human species isn’t steeped 
in solidarity and mutual aid, everyone will go in search of bread in competition 
with others in the same manner that snarling dogs will fight each other over the 
opportunity to chew up a rancid bone.This is the truth in all social classes.The 
rich man, envious of the wealth of another rich man, will make war on him in 
order to augment his own treasure with the plundered wealth of the other.This 
is called, with the hypocrisy of the epoch, “competition.” The poor man, for his 
part, is the enemy of his equally poor brothers.The poor man sees an enemy in

<p>
land, to yank it from the claws that hold it now, and deliver it to the people.Then 
the poor will have bread; then the people will come to be free; then, with a little 
more effort, well come close to the ideal that we see from afar because the lead¬ 
ers of the revolutions haven’t had the guts to throw down idols, to slay prejudices, 
to break into pieces the law which protects this crime called private property. 
</p>

<p>
One must, however, speak honestly.The people s taking possession of the 
land will be a great step toward the ideal of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity. But only a 
great step. However, thanks to it, the people will have the opportunity to obtain 
the education they need in order to construct, in the more or less near future, the 
just and wise society that today is only a pretty illusion. 
</p>

<p>
And while there is no effective advance along the road of economic liber¬ 
ation, no healthy work will be done. Liberty cannot exist while one part of society 
makes the laws that the rest must obey. Since it’s easy to comprehend that nobody 
will make a law contrary to their own interests, and as the class that possesses the 
riches makes the laws or, at least, orders that they be made, this must result, in toto, 
in laws favorable to the capitalists and unfavorable to the poor. That’s the reason 
that the law doesn’t extend its reach to punish the rich and doesn’t bother them 
at all for any reason. All of the social and political costs fall upon the poor. Taxes 
must be paid exclusively by the poor. Gratuitous services, such as night watchman 
rounds, unpaid extra hours of work, and others, weigh exclusively upon the backs 
of the poor; the army recruits exclusively among the proletariat; and in brothels 
the daughters of the rich are not degraded, solely the daughters of the poor.This 
is inevitable, it's absurd to think that the rich would make laws contrary to their 
own interests. 
</p>

<p>
Under such conditions, can equality exist? Socially, equality is a chimera 
under present conditions. How can the rich and poor be equals? Neither in ap¬ 
pearance, nor in dress, nor in living style are the dominators and the dominated 
similar. The work of the poor is hard and tiring; their lives are a series of priva¬ 
tions and worries, caused by their misery; their distractions are scarce: alcohol and 
sex; they can’t partake in the enjoyments of the rich because those cost a lot of 
money and, besides, they don’t have the clothes to mingle with elegant people; 
the manner in which they’ve lived hasn’t been the best preparation for acquiring 
cultivated manners; the opera and drama, apart from being costly, require a certain 
artistic or literary preparation that the poor cannot have, having been pushed 
since children to earn the bread they need to survive. 
</p>

<p>
So, equality before the law is one of the greatest idiocies those who wish 
to govern offer the masses. If social equality is impossible while there are social

<p>
CHAPTER FIVE: CLASS WAR ★ 193

<p>
if you want to do something revolutionary rather than the vulgar work of politi¬ 
cians, it is necessary to place one’s hands upon “private” lands. While the earth 
continues to be the property of a few; while there are millions of human beings 
who have no more than the tiny space needed to lay out their cadaver when they 
die; while the poor continue to work the land for their bosses, any “revolution” 
will have no other outcome than a change of bosses—and at times the new ones 
will be worse than the ones thrown out. 
</p>

<p>
The revolution is imminent. At any moment the telegraph cable will an¬ 
nounce to all of the nations of the Earth that the Mexican people are rebelling. 
The assaults of the tyranny are growing in brutality, and every time it is done 
more cynically. Porfirio Diaz is crazy: he’s no longer content with snatching the 
lives of men, but he’s also murdering women whose corpses lay unattended to 
be eaten by dogs.The Old Beast is precipitating the revolution, and the ambitious 
will take advantage of it if the people do not take possession of the land. 
</p>

<p>
Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: three beautiful words which it is necessary to 
make into three beautiful acts. Let the revolutionaries place their hands upon this 
god called “the right of private property” and make the land belong to everyone. 
</p>

<p>
If there is going to be bloodshed, let it be for the good of the people.To 
shed blood to elevate a candidate to the presidency of the republic is a crime, 
because the ills which afflict the Mexican people won’t be cured by kicking out 
Diaz and putting another in his place. Let’s suppose that the most honorable of 
citizens, the best man in Mexico, triumphed byway of arms and came to occupy 
the spot now possessed by the most perverse and criminal of Mexicans: Porfirio 
Diaz. That which this good man would do would be to put in force the Consti¬ 
tution of 1857. The people, therefore, would have the right to vote; they would 
have the right to freely express their ideas; the press wouldn’t be gagged; there 
would be a division of powers in the federation; the states would recover their 
sovereignty; there would be no perpetual re-election of the same man. In sum, the 
Mexican people would obtain what is called political liberty. But would this make 
the people happy? The right to vote, the right to meet, the right to write about 
any matter, the doing away with “re-election,” the division of powers—would this 
provide bread, shelter, and clothing to the people? 
</p>

<p>
It’s necessary to say it one more time: political liberty doesn’t give the 
people anything to eat; it is necessary to achieve economic liberty, which is the 
basis of all the liberties; and without it political liberty is a bloody irony which 
converts “the people as king” into the king of jokes, because if in theory the peo¬ 
ple are free, in reality they are slaves. So it is necessary to take possession of the

<p>
ity without filling it. What is necessary is for humanity to smother in blood all of 
the prejudices, traditions, religious fanaticism, and laws that oppress it. 
</p>

<p>
The great revolutions have had as their goal these three things: Liberty, 
Equality, Fraternity. These words have been inscribed on a hundred banners and 
hundreds of thousands of men have had them on their lips as they died on the 
fields of battle; and, nonetheless, the abyss doesn’t fill; the blood level doesn’t rise. 
Why? 
</p>

<p>
No revolution has seriously concerned itself with Equality, which is the 
basis for Liberty and Fraternity. Equality before the law, which was won in the 
French Revolution, is a lie which is rejected by modern consciousness. Revolu¬ 
tions up till now have been superficial wildfires.They could burn the trees in the 
woods, but the roots remained intact.Thus the revolutions so far have been super¬ 
ficial because they haven’t gotten to the root of social evil; they haven’t scraped 
away the putrefied flesh to get to the bottom of the wound; and for this their so- 
called leaders are to blame. 
</p>

<p>
The leaders have always been less radical than the men they pretend to 
lead, and there is a reason for this: power makes a man conservative, and in addi¬ 
tion he falls in love with ruling others. In order not to lose their positions, leaders 
moderate their radicalism; they compromise it; they disfigure it; they avoid clashes 
with opposing interests. And if in the nature of things a clash is inevitable and 
armed struggle is necessary, leaders always arrange things so that their positions 
are not in danger and they conciliate, as much as they can, with the interests of 
the ruling class, managing thus to diminish the intensity of the clash and the dura¬ 
tion of the struggle; they content themselves with obtaining a more or less easy, 
superficial victory .The ideal&#x2026; the ideal remains very distant after these struggles 
of dwarves. With such struggles one scratches the surface and not much more. 
</p>

<p>
Because of this, and despite the blood spilled throughout the ages; despite 
the sacrifice of so many noble men; despite the beautiful words Liberty, Equality, 
Fraternity having glowed on a hundred banners, the chains still exist. Society is 
still divided into classes and the war of all against all is still what is normal, what is 
legal, what is honored, what the “serious” call “order,” what the tyrants call “prog¬ 
ress,” and what the slaves, blinded by their ignorance and made timid by centuries 
of oppression and injustice, venerate and sustain through their submission. 
</p>

<p>
It’s necessary to go deeper, to get to the bottom of things.The leaders are 
cowards; they don’t go deep and they don’t get to the bottom of things.The revo¬ 
lutionary impulse always stumbles over the moderation of the so-called leaders, 
who are deft politicians, if you will, but who lack revolutionary vigor. Above all,

</p>

<p>
How far is the ideal, how far! A mirage in the desert, a phantasm of the 
steppes, the twinkling image of a star reflected in a lake. First was the bottomless 
abyss separating humanity from the promised land. How to fill this abyss? How to 
plug it? How to reach the inviting beach that we divine is on the far shore? The 
thirsty Arab suddenly sees the waving of palm fronds in the distance and whips 
his camel toward them. It’s in vain: he advances toward the oasis and the oasis 
appears to recede in the distance.The distance is always the same between him 
and it, always the same. 
</p>

<p>
Defending the abyss are prejudices, traditions, religious fanaticism, the 
law. In order to be able to cross this abyss, one must vanquish its defenders until 
the abyss is filled with blood and then sail over this new Red Sea. 
</p>

<p>

in the streets of New York or Chicago.This is to say that in Russia, that barbarous 
and oppressive country, there exists the same problem, the same social question 
as exists in the United States, the country that boasts of being free and civilized. 
</p>

<p>
In Canada, despite there being no law guaranteeing everyone the right to 
vote, that is, in that land where there is nothing called “universal suffrage,” where 
only those with property can vote, the worker lives with more ease than in the 
United States where universal suffrage exists, that is, where every man of a certain 
age can elect his rulers. 
</p>

<p>
This proves that it is not the vote, not the right to think freely, not the 
right to meet freely, nor any of the other political rights conferred by law which 
gives the worker food to survive. The right to vote is a joke. Here, in the United 
States, we have proof of this.The people of this nation have always had the right 
to vote and, nonetheless, the miserable ghettos of New York, Chicago, St. Louis, 
Philadelphia, and of all of the other great American cities are eloquent witnesses 
to the inefficiency of the vote in bringing about the happiness of the people. In 
these ghettos, hundreds of thousands of persons rot, both physically and morally, 
in squalid tenements, and in the entire nation, every morning four million human 
beings leave these palaces of filth and hunger to search for work so that they 
can return to these palaces with a crumb of bread for their wives and children; 
but as they often don’t find work, they return with empty hands, their stomachs 
pinched, and they go out again the next day on their perilous, wandering journey 
in search of bosses to whom to rent their arms. And when election time rolls 
around, these hungry wretches clamor to fill out ballots to elevate another ruler 
who will continue to weigh down upon their necks. 
</p>

<p>
If we have this example before us, why would we attempt to gain the 
illusory power oi the right to vote? Wouldn’t it be better to dedicate ourselves to 
the conquest of the lands, the lands which are the fount of all riches and which, 
in the hands of the people, would assure to all the means of life, and by the same 
measure economic liberty—and as a consequence of this true liberty? 
</p>

<p>
Material well-being is what the people need to be free.That the people 
take possession of the earth and of the instruments of production is what the Par- 
tido Liberal wants. When the people themselves are the lords of the earth, every¬ 
thing else will fall into their hands through the force of this circumstance. Is this 
crazy?That’s what the cowards,the ignorant, and all those who have an interest in 
the continuation of the present system of exploitation of the working class say. All 
of those who desire to occupy great or small public offices, all of those who want 
to live at the expense of others, desire that Madero will triumph. But those con-

<p>
The capitalist class, under whatever form of government, can live idly, 
because it is in a materially advantageous situation in respect to those who have 
nothing, that is, the workers; and the capitalist class enjoys by the same measure a 
great deal of independence and a great deal of liberty, since not only can it satisfy 
its needs without being beholden to anyone, but in addition it is supported by 
the governmental apparatus upon which it depends, with its laws, judges, police, 
soldiers, and prisons. In short, the capitalist class has all the means necessary to 
guarantee its free enjoyment of its riches. 
</p>

<p>
The poor class, in virtue of finding material wealth monopolized by the 
rich, is forced to depend on the rich. If the poor man wants to work the earth, he 
has to rent himself for a price (“wages”) which represents a small part of what he 
produces with his arms. If the worker wants to work in a factory, in a mine, on a 
ship, on a railway, in construction building a house, or any other kind of work, he 
equally has to rent his arms in order to receive a wage which represents, always, 
a small part of what he produces. It has been calculated that the bosses pay only 
a tenth the value of what is produced by the worker’s labor, and in Mexico it’s 
even worse, because as is well known wages in our country amount to little more 
than alms. Nine-tenths of what a worker produces passes into the pockets of the 
boss as profit, despite his having worked nowhere near as hard as the worker .This 
profit, naturally, is protected by the law which, as I’ve said many times, is a prod¬ 
uct, as are all laws, of the capitalist class; this class, of course, has to make laws that 
benefit itself, laws that protect the exploitation of workers by their bosses.These 
laws prevail in all parts of the world, in all of the so-called civilized countries, from 
those ruled by absolute monarchs to those governed by constitutional presidents, 
as in the United States and Switzerland, both renowned as “free” countries, as 
“model” republics. 
</p>

<p>
The worker, then, is a slave everywhere. A slave in Russia, a slave in the 
United States, a slave in Mexico, a slave in Turkey, a slave in France—a slave liter¬ 
ally every where. The famous political liberties which Maderismo [the movement 
to put Francisco Madero in power] wants to conquer, such as the rights to vote, to 
meet publicly, to think freely, and many others, are in truth nothing but swindles 
which divert the proletariat from its sacred mission: economic liberty. Without 
economic liberty, it’s not possible to enjoy political liberty. 
</p>

<p>
There are countries, such as Russia, for example, where there are no po¬ 
litical liberties and, nonetheless, the worker is no more unfortunate than he is in 
the United States, the country which trumpets its “freedom.” In the streets of Saint 
Petersburg, Moscow, or Odessa you’ll see the same rags, the same pallid faces as

Rebel indignantly, brother. Go and take up arms, but not with your op¬ 
pressors, not with Madero, but with your brothers, the members of the Partido 
Liberal Mexieano. Madero wants you to continue working as you have, since his 
“revolution” only benefits the members of the upper classes. 
</p>

<p>
Rebel with the unbreakable resolution to take possession of the earth 
and of the means of production for the benefit of all. Remember that the earth 
came to be in the power of a few only by means of conquest, that is, violence, 
and through other more or less evil means such as robbery, fraud, cunning, and 
speculation.Those who didn’t obtain it through any of these means bought it or 
inherited it. And if they bought it, they bought it with the money that was created 
through the sweat of the working class. 
</p>

<p>
The members of the Partido Liberal are not going to commit a robbery, 
but rather an act of justice, the most beautiful act of justice that has been contem¬ 
plated in centuries, the most sublime witnessed throughout the ages. 
</p>

<p>
Women: push your men to work for the happiness of your family. It’s 
shameful that in this century there are poor and rich. Science has shown that 
we are all equal, that all, inherently, have a right to live.To conquer this right we 
must take possession of the earth and the machinery, and labor no more for the 
bosses.

Humanity is divided into two classes: the capitalist class and the work¬ 
ing class.The capitalist class possesses the lands, the machinery, the factories, the 
workshops, the tools of labor, the mines, the houses, the railways, the ships, and 
other means of transportation, and as the keeper of all of these, it can count on 
the government in any of its forms: absolute monarchy, constitutional monarchy, 
and republic, be it in centralized or federated form. The working class possesses 
no more than its arms, its brains, and the essential energy invested in performing 
any kind of labor—while it can remain on its feet.

DISCORD 
</p>

<p>
Regeneration October 29 , 1910 
</p>

<p>
(translated by M.V) 
</p>

<p>
Imagine the earth without mountains, the ocean without waves, the 
heavens without stars, the flower without colors. Imagine all the birds adorned 
in the same plumage, all the insects displaying the same form and color. Imagine 
the plains without any rises, without any unevenness; sand and pebbles here, sand 
and pebbles there, sand and pebbles everywhere; not a tree, not a shrub; nothing 
to break the monotony of the landscape, nothing to interrupt the uniformity of 
the scene; neither a brook that murmurs, nor a canary that sings, nor a breeze to 
remind that there is movement, that there is action. Imagine, finally, a humanity, 
without passions, all having the same tastes, all thinking in the same way, and 
decide whether it would not be preferable to die at once than to suffer the pro¬ 
longed death agony of having no choice but to live under these conditions. 
</p>

<p>
Order, uniformity, symmetry appear to be better than death. Life is disor¬ 
der, is struggle, is critique, is disagreement, is a tumult of passions. From this chaos 
emerges beauty, from this confusion emerges science; from criticism, from con¬ 
flict, from discord, from the tumult of passions, beams of light shine like embers, 
yet are enormous like suns: truth and liberty. Discord: here you have the great 
creative agent that works in nature. The actions and the reactions in inorganic 
and organic material, generators of movement, of heat, of light, of beauty: what 
are they if not the work of discord? Breaking the monotony of the simple sub¬ 
stances, discord brings them closer to each other, mixes them, combines them, 
crushes them to bits and transports them from one place to another: the iron that 
sleeps in the entrails of the earth is the same that blazes across the terrestrial at¬ 
mosphere as a meteorite, that reddens the lips of a woman, and that gleams in the 
blade of a dagger; the carbon that appears black in the ashes of a fire is the same 
that appears green and handsome in the leaves of plants, clear like a droplet of 
dew in a diamond, warm and endearing in the breath of a beloved woman. All is 
transformed by discord: it dissolves and creates, destroys and creates. 
</p>

<p>
In human societies, discord plays the most important role. An innova¬ 
tor, it breaks the old molds and creates new ones; it destroys traditions that are 
cherished, but which are pernicious to progress, and it puts new longings, new 
fires into the soul of the people, after it has extinguished the embers that still 
warm the cold, senile old ideals. An aesthete, it pushes art from its beaten path

<p>
and makes it take new routes, where there are sources the literary herd has not 
yet discovered, new colors, new harmonies, unexpected turns of phrase that have 
never existed on any palette, that have never vibrated in any string, which have 
never sprung like jets of light from any pen. Always revolutionary, discord makes 
disgust ferment in proletarian breasts until, their nerves stressed until they are 
ready to snap, desperation makes hands search for rocks, bombs, daggers, revolv¬ 
ers, rifles, and men cast themselves against injustice, each one disposed to be a 
hero. 
</p>

<p>
While the poor acquiesce to being poor, while the oppressed acquiesce 
to being slaves there will be no liberty, there will be no progress. But when dis¬ 
cord tempts the hearts of the humble, when it comes and tells them that while 
they suffer their masters rejoice, and that we all have the right to rejoice and to 
live, the passions then blaze and they destroy and create at the same time, ravage 
and cultivate, demolish and build. Blessed be discord!

DEATH TO ORDER! 
</p>

<p>
Regeneration, May 13, 1911 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by M.Y) 
</p>

<p>
“Order, order! ” This is the whine of those who advocate what today is 
called “order.” Order, for these poor people, can only exist by subjecting humanity 
to the clubs of the policeman, the soldier, the judge, the jailer, the executioner, and 
the governor. 
</p>

<p>
But this is not order. I understand order to be harmony; and harmony 
neither can nor should exist while upon this planet’s surface there are human 
beings who gorge themselves and others who do not even have a crust of bread 
to lift to their mouths 
</p>

<p>
If things were well arranged, if every member of the human species had 
enough to eat, had a place to shelter himself from harsh weather without hav¬ 
ing to pay rent, in a word, if everyone, from just doing a bit of work in healthy 
conditions each day, had everything he needed to live decently, without worrying 
about the future, then there would be no one who would dare say: I am greater 
than you, obey me! 
</p>


<p>
CHAPTER ELEVEN: PHILOSOPHICAL * 273 
</p>




<p>
Then there would be order because there would be harmony. No one 
would have to quarrel with anyone else; no one would have to envy anyone else. All 
would be brothers, and the policeman, the soldier, the judge, the jailer, the execu¬ 
tioner, and the governor would be gone because they’d be useless. They would 
be useless because, once harmony between human beings was won through the 
triumph of economic freedom, the parasitism of public officials would no longer 
have any reason to exist. 
</p>

<p>
Public functionaries are not, as is commonly believed, the guardians of 
order. Order, which is harmony, does not need guardians, precisely because it is 
order. What does need guardians is disorder, and what reigns in the political and 
social life of humanity is a scandalous, shameful and humiliating disorder for those 
of us who were not born to be slaves. 
</p>

<p>
Disorder consists of one social class holding down another social class, 
for there should exist only one class: that of the producers, that is, that of the 
workers. Humanity will be converted into the working class when the land and 
the machinery belong to everyone, for then everyone will have to work in order 
to eat. 
</p>

<p>
Maintaining disorder, that is, maintaining political and social inequality, 
maintaining the privileges of the upper class and the submission of the lower 
class—those are the things that require rulers, laws, cops, soldiers, jailers, judges, 
hangmen, and the whole throng of great and small functionaries who suck the 
life from the peoples of the Earth .These officials do not exist to protect humanity, 
but rather to keep it in submission, to enslave it for the benefit of those who have 
contrived to the present moment to monopolize the land and the machinery 
</p>

<p>
“Order! Order!’’This is the whine of those who advocate disorder, that is, 
those who advocate social and political inequality among the human species. 
</p>

<p>
No. Order is not the enslavement of one part of humanity by another, 
but rather liberty for the entire human species.To bourgeois “order,” we Mexicans 
answer with our rebellion. Against this “order,” we shout:“death to order! ” because 
this is the “order” that binds the hands of a human being’s free initiative, because 
it is the order of the barracks or the penitentiary. Death to order!

<p>
THE RIGHT TO PROPERTY 
</p>

<p>
Regeneracion, March 18, 1911 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by M.V.) 
</p>

<p>
Among all the absurdities that humanity venerates, this is one of the 
greatest as well as one of the most venerated. 
</p>

<p>
The right to property is archaic, as ancient as the stupidity and blindness 
of men; but the antiquity alone of a right can not give it the right to survive. If it 
is an absurd right, it must be aborted, no matter how it was born when humanity 
covered its nakedness with animal hides. 
</p>

<p>
The right to property is an absurd right because it originates in crime, 
fraud, and the abuse of force. In the beginning, the right of a single individual to 
territorial property did not exist.The lands were worked in common, the forests 
provided firewood for the homes of everyone, and the harvests were distributed 
to members of the community according to their needs. Examples of this natural 
condition can be seen even now in some primitive tribes; in Mexico this practice 
still flourished among indigenous communities during the epoch of Spanish dom¬ 
ination, and it still survived until a few years ago. The despotic attempt to seize 
lands from indigenous tribes, lands that they cultivated in common for centuries, 
was the cause of war with the Yaqui in Sonora and the Maya in the Yucatan. 
</p>

<p>
The right of a single person to territorial property was born in the at¬ 
tack of the first ambitious person who brought war against a neighboring tribe in 
order to subdue them into servitude, putting the land which this tribe cultivated 
in common under the control of the conqueror and his captains. Thus, it was 
through violence, through the abuse of force, that private territorial property was 
born. Financial speculation, fraud, more or less legal robbery, but in all ways rob¬ 
bery—these were the other origins of private property. Afterwards, once the first 
thieves turned the earth over to themselves, they made laws to defend what they 
called and still call in this century a “right,” that is, the ability that they give them¬ 
selves to use lands which have been stolen and to enjoy the produce of the lands 
without being molested. One must notice well that it was not the despoiled who 
gave the right of ownership of the lands to those thieves; it was not the people 
of any country who gave them the license to appropriate the good of nature, to 
which all human beings have a right. It was the thieves themselves who did it by 
force, writing the laws that would protect their crimes and keep the despoiled 
away from recovering what was rightfully theirs. 
</p>


<p>
CHAPTER ELEVEN: PHILOSOPHICAL ★ 275 
</p>




<p>
This so-called right of property has descended, transmitted from fathers 
to sons through inheritance, making all these goods, which should be possessed 
in common, remain at the disposition of one social caste, to the flagrant disadvan¬ 
tage of the rest of humanity, whose members began their lives well after the land 
had already been allotted to a handful of idlers. 
</p>

<p>
The origin of territorial property has been violence, and by violence it is 
still sustained: thus, if any man wants to use a scrap of earth without the consent 
of it’s so-called owner, he must go to jail, which is guarded closely by cops who 
are sustained not by the owner of the lands, but by the working people. Even 
though the taxes apparently emerge from the coffers of the rich, they have con¬ 
trived to reimburse themselves by paying starvation wages to the workers and 
by selling them primary necessities at a high price. Therefore, the people, with 
their work, sustain the cops who prevent them from taking back what belongs to 
them. 
</p>

<p>
And if this is the origin of territorial property, if the right to property 
is nothing but the legal consecration of crime, why do they raise their arms in 
prayer to heaven when one knows that the Mexican Liberal Party is working to 
expropriate the land monopolized by the rich—that is, by the descendants of the 
thieves who appropriated it through crime—in order to hand it over to its natural 
master, the people, that is, all the inhabitants of Mexico? 
</p>

<p>
Some of Madero’s followers sympathize with the idea of delivering the 
land to the people; but, conservative to the end, they want to decree the action in 
a solemn legal setting; that is, they waul the congress to decree the expropriation. 
I have written much about the matter, and I wonder that there are those who 
apparently cannot understand what I’ve said, because I have the presumption 
to believe that I’ve spoken very clearly. No congress, 1 have said,“would dare to 
decree the expropriation of the land, because the benches of congress are not 
filled with the workers, but with their bosses; they are not filled with the ignorant 
and the poor, but with the intellectuals and the rich.”That is to say, you’ll find in 
congress representatives of the so-called directing classes: the rich, the educated, 
the men of science, the professionals—but no worker of the pick and the shovel, 
no peasant, no worker would be allowed to squeeze through; and if, by some 
veritable miracle a worker would manage to cross the threshold of the legislative 
chamber, how could he fight against men accustomed to such verbal battles? How 
could he make his ideas prevail if he lacked the scientific knowledge that the 
bourgeoisie possesses in abundance? But, let us suppose that the working people 
did send competent representatives to the congress.Throughout the world, these 
</p>


<p>
276 ★ DREAMS OF FREEDOM 
</p>




<p>
so-called workers’ representatives in parliaments are held in contempt. They are 
as bourgeois as every other representative. What have the labor representatives 
of the English people done in the House of Commons? What are the achieve¬ 
ments of the workers’ representatives in the French Parliament? In the German 
parliament, there are a great many workers’ representatives, and what have they 
done on behalf of the economic liberty of the workers? The Austro-Hungarian 
parliament is notable for the growing number of workers’ representatives who 
sit on its benches, but nevertheless the problem of hunger remains unresolved in 
Austro-Hungary, as in every country where there are no labor representatives in 
the congress. 
</p>

<p>
It is necessary, therefore, to give up these illusions.The expropriation of 
the earth from the hands of the rich must be accomplished during the present 
insurrection. We liberals will not be committing a crime by handing the land over 
to the working people, because it is theirs, the people’s: it is the land which their 
most distant ancestors lived upon and irrigated with their sweat; the land which 
the Spanish invaders stole by force from our Indian forefathers; the land that these 
invaders handed down through their estates to their descendants, who currently 
possess it. This land belongs to all Mexicans by natural right. Some people have 
purchased it; but from where was the money for making this purchase extracted 
if not from the labor of the Mexican peasants and laborers? Others took this land 
by claiming it as wasteland; but even if it were just wasteland, it belongs to the 
people, and no one has the right to give it to someone who offers a few pesos for 
it. Others have acquired the land by taking advantage of their friendship with men 
of government, obtaining it without it costing them a single penny, as if it were 
wasteland. If the land belongs to one of the dictator’s enemies or to some person 
without influence or money, others have gotten it through judicial corruption. 
Still others have acquired the land through making loans to subsidize small ranch¬ 
ers, which, in the end, wound up obligating these ranchers, powerless to pay their 
debts, to relinquish their fields to the hands of the moneylender. 
</p>

<p>
Comrades, all who believe that the course pursued by the Partido Liberal 
is humanitarian should try to persuade those who still adore capital and venerate 
the so-called right to property that the Partido Liberal is in the right, that its work 
will be a work of justice, and that the Mexican people will be truly great when 
they can enjoy, without obstacles, land and liberty.

<p>
SOLIDARITY 
</p>

<p>
Regeneracion, October 29, 1910 
</p>


<p>
(translated by M.V.) 
</p>

<p>
Before the spectacle of the bestial struggle of all against all that began 
with the appearance of the first lord over the earth, and which has been pro¬ 
longed until our days, producing as a logical result the division of humanity into 
two classes, of oppressors and oppressed, of masters and slaves, before the spec¬ 
tacle of this struggle which has completely alienated man from man, and which 
makes the men of one nation seem to be the natural enemies of other nations, be¬ 
fore this apparently eternal spectacle of war, one must ask: has man progressed? 
</p>

<p>
The material progress achieved by humanity is enormous: it is gigantic 
if compared to the moral progress; for while we all admire the phonograph, the 
camera, the wireless telegraph, and aerial navigation, the more noble conceptions 
of philosophy—those which, when put in practice, would open ample horizons 
to the free enjoyment of the blessings of life—are being asphyxiated between the 
bindings of rarely opened, and, even worse, rarely understood books. 
</p>

<p>
It isn’t strange then that, today like yesterday, the struggle for life retains 
the same character of ferocity, of reciprocal hostility that makes man, as Hobbes 
says, a wolf to man: “homo hominis lupus.” No, it is not strange that the man of 
today who knows how to use electricity and who lias discovered how to fly has, 
regarding other men, the same sentiment of animosity that made the caveman’s 
blood boil when, returning from the hunt, he found in his rocky home a bear or 
a hyena prepared to fight him for housing and for food. Humanity progresses, but 
in one direction only. 
</p>

<p>
For this reason, when one speaks of solidarity, those who understand 
are very few. Solidarity is the consciousness of the common interest, and the ac¬ 
tions that follow from this consciousness. Despite its simplicity, solidarity is an 
unknown concept to almost everyone. An increasingly greater egoism dominates 
men’s relations between themselves. Isolated protests against this state of affairs 
perish as quickly as they are formulated, silenced by the racket of the struggle; 
noble spirits who dare to raise themselves up among the combatants to preach 
brotherhood fall to pieces like flowers trampled underfoot by a stampede of 
beasts, for each redeemer, there is a Cavalry or a Montjuich. 
</p>

<p>
And in this implacable struggle, the victorious are always the same: the 
clever and the wicked. The only difference is that yesterday they justified their 
</p>


<p>
278 ★ DREAMS OF FREEDOM 
</p>




<p>
triumph as a result of divine will, and today, embarrassed, they justify their depre¬ 
dations with science. Darwin’s theory of natural selection, which explains how in¬ 
dividuals better endowed for the struggle of life are the ones who triumph, is the 
rationalization that the rich and the despotic brandish against those who question 
their appropriation of the right to exploit and to oppress, even though they are 
forgetting to say, because this benefits them, that animals of the same species do 
not destroy each other, nor do some declare themselves the masters of the oth¬ 
ers. The struggle of species is directed against other species, but a single species 
works together in its process of adapting to the environment. Only the human 
species displays the repugnant spectacle of some individuals devouring the oth¬ 
ers, producing through this an obvious retardation of progress, when, by acting in 
solidarity thousands of years ago it would have been able to control nature and 
obtain across-the-board progress. 
</p>

<p>
Ignorance of humanity’s common interest, that is, ignorance of solidarity, 
makes each man see in the other man a competitor who must be vanquished so 
that he can live. The rich man lives off the poor; but in turn he fears that other 
rich people might ruin him in order to enrich themselves further. The poor man, 
for his part, sees in each newborn one more mouth that will reduce the portion 
of bread that the rich permit him to eat, and in each poor person an enemy who 
could be hired for cheaper wages, leaving him and his family without bread. 
</p>

<p>
This implacable struggle, which originates in the lack of solidarity among 
all human beings, kills in man, or at least weakens in him, the instinct of sociality 
which is characteristic of the superior animal species, thereby making him a liar, 
a fraud, a coward, and an egotist. In this way, the wicked, the insincere, the greedy, 
and the brutal triumph, and for this reason, even though material progress is great, 
the still more beautiful philosophical concepts live only in the pages of books 
consumed by moths on library shelves. 
</p>

<p>
However, seeing how the rich and distinguished classes do not under¬ 
stand this solidarity or pretend not to understand it, or, at most practice it only 
when it concerns the narrow interests of their class, without understanding or 
practicing the solidarity that should unite the human species into a single intel¬ 
ligent and active force and place nature at man’s service; seeing the aggressions of 
these dominating classes, the proletarian class should unite; it should tighten its 
ranks in order to be able to unleash a decisive battle in which it would have to be 
victorious for it contains the greater number of individuals. 
</p>

<p>
Instead of seeing in each poor person a bothersome competitor, one 
more mouth against whom we must compete for the crumbs the rich contemptu- 
</p>

<p>
ously give us as wages, we should think of him as our brother; we should make 
him understand that our interests are his, and that we should join together in the 
struggle against the dominating class. Is there a strike? It is in the interest of all 
to help out those who are on strike. To take a job replacing a striker is an act of 
treason to the common interest of the poor, because this only helps the oppress¬ 
ing classes and delivers nothing to the oppressed classes.To take a job for less pay 
than the other worker earns is equally an act of treason, because it is making the 
rich receive more and is worsening the condition of the working class through 
the reduction of salaries. One must consider an injury to one an injury to all. 
</p>

<p>
In the revolution that is coming, the Mexican worker must show his 
solidarity. By uniting forcefully with other workers he could turn the revolution 
toward his desires, toward the course that agrees with his interests.Taking pos¬ 
session of the land, increasing wages, and decreasing working hours, along with 
improving education, will be the first preparatory advances toward the great final 
battle that will snatch from the hands of the few the things necessary to the pro¬ 
duction and distribution of wealth. But one must understand well: this can only 
be accomplished if the revolution is conducted with this aim in mind. However, 
if the proletarians deviate, starting a revolution only to indulge in the luxury of 
having a new president, or what amounts to the same thing, a new master, they 
should understand they will not alleviate their misery in this manner, nor shall 
they approach the ideal of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity that should live in the 
hearts of all men and all women.

SPEECH IN EL MONTE, CA 
</p>

<p>
1917 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
I want to say a few words to you about a bad habit which is common 
in human beings. I refer to indifference, the bad habit of not paying attention to 
matters that affect the interest of humanity in general. 
</p>

<p>
Everyone has interest in his own matters and those of the persons near 
to him, and nothing more; everyone looks after his own well-being and that of his 
family, and nothing more, without realizing that the well-being of the individual 
</p>


<p>
280 ★ DREAMS OF FREEDOM 
</p>




<p>
depends on the well-being of everyone else, and that the well-being of a collectiv¬ 
ity, of a people, of humanity, is the product of conditions which make it possible, 
is the result of favorable circumstances, is the natural, logical consequence of a 
measure of liberty and justice. 
</p>

<p>
Well then, the well-being of everyone depends on the well-being of the 
rest—well-being that can only be possible through a measure of liberty and jus¬ 
tice, because if tyranny rules, if inequality is the norm, the only ones who can 
enjoy well-being are the oppressors, those who are above the rest, those whose 
privileges are founded in inequality 
</p>

<p>
Therefore, the duty of all is to concern themselves with the general inter¬ 
est of humanity through pursuing creation of an environment favorable to the 
well-being of all. Only in this manner will the individual enjoy true well-being. 
</p>

<p>
But we see that in current life the exact opposite is the case. Each one 
struggles and sacrifices for his personal well-being, and he doesn’t obtain it, be¬ 
cause his struggle is not directed against the conditions which are an obstacle to 
the well-being of all. The human being struggles, he strives, he sacrifices himself 
to win his bread each day; but this struggle, this striving, this sacrifice doesn’t 
yield the desired result, that is, it doesn’t produce the well-being of the individual 
because he doesn’t direct his efforts to change the general conditions of life; creat¬ 
ing circumstances favorable to all individuals doesn’t enter into the calculations 
of the individual that struggles, strives, sacrifices himself—only the mean interest 
in the satisfying of individual necessities, without appreciation of the needs of the 
rest, and often even with disregard of the needs of others. No one is interested in 
the fortunes of the rest. He who is working only thinks of not losing his job and is 
happy when he’s not among the number who get laid off, while at the same time 
he who doesn’t have a job longs for the moment in which the rich man discharges 
some worker so that he can see himself, in this manner, obtain the vacant post; 
and there are even some so vile, so abject,that they don’t hesitate in offering their 
arms for lower pay, and others who during strikes rush to fill the jobs temporarily 
abandoned by the strikers. 
</p>

<p>
In sum, the workers fight over bread; they snatch mouthfuls away from 
each other; one is the enemy of the other, because every individual only seeks his 
own well-being without concern for the well-being of the rest; and this antago¬ 
nism between members of the same class, this deaf struggle for mere crumbs, 
makes our slavery permanent, it perpetuates misery, it creates our misfortune, 
because we don’t understand that our interest is that of our neighbor, because 
we sacrifice ourselves for poorly understood individual interest, seeking in vain 
</p>


<p>
CHAPTER ELEVEN: PHILOSOPHICAL * 281 
</p>




<p>
the well-being that can only be the result of our interest in the matters that con¬ 
cern humanity as a whole—an interest that, if intensified and generalized, would 
yield as its product the transformation of the present conditions of life, which 
are not suited to procuring the well-being of all because they are founded in the 
antagonism of individual interests, in contrast to those based on the harmony of 
interests, in fraternity and justice. 
</p>

<p>
Therefore, understand comrades that in order to achieve well-being it is 
necessary, it is indispensable, to pay attention to the general interest of humanity, 
setting aside indifference, because indifference makes our slavery eternal. We all 
feel unfortunate; but we don’t try to find one of the principal causes of our mis¬ 
fortune, which is our indifference, our apathy toward the general interest. 
</p>

<p>
Indifference is our chain, and we ourselves are our own tyrants because 
we make no effort to destroy it. Indifferent and apathetic, we see ourselves file by 
earthly affairs with the same impassivity as if they were taking place on another 
planet; and as everyone is interested only in his own person, without concern 
for the general interest, for the common interests of all people, no one feels the 
need to unite with others to be strong in the struggle for the general interest.This 
results in there being no solidarity among the oppressed, that there are no limits 
on the abuses by government, and that the bosses of all types make prisoners of 
us, enslave us, exploit us, oppress us, and humiliate us. 
</p>

<p>
When we reflect that all who suffer the same evils have the same inter¬ 
est, an interest common to all of the oppressed, and we decide to be in solidarity 
with cadi other, then well be capable of transforming the circumstances that 
produce our misfortunes into those that are favorable to our liberty and well-be¬ 
ing. 
</p>

<p>
Let us leave behind the ciasping of hands and anxiously asking our¬ 
selves what will be effective in resisting the assaults of governmental tyranny and 
capitalist exploitation. The remedy is in our hands: that all who suffer the same 
evils unite, certain that before our solidarity the abuses of those who base their 
strength in our separation and indifference will crumble. 
</p>

<p>
The tyrants have no more force than we give them with our indifference. 
The tyrants are not the ones to blame for our misfortunes; we ourselves are. It’s 
necessary to confess it: if the bourgeois strain us with hard labor and demand the 
last drop of our sweat, who do we owe this evil to but ourselves, who haven’t 
known how to oppose this bourgeois exploitation through protest and rebellion? 
How can the government not oppress us when it knows that any of its orders, 
no matter how unjust and no matter how much it wounds our dignity as men, is 
</p>


<p>
282 ★ DREAMS OF FREEDOM 
</p>




<p>
observed by us, with our eyes cast down, without even a murmur, without even 
a gesture than shows our discontent and anger? And aren’t we ourselves, the dis¬ 
inherited, the oppressed, the poor, those who lend ourselves to receiving from 
the hands of our oppressors the guns destined to exterminate our working class 
brothers, in those rare moments in which the herd and its habitual indifference 
are replaced by an explosion of dignified, honorable actions? Don’t the policeman 
and the majordomo, the jailer and the hangman come from our ranks, from the 
great proletarian mass? 
</p>

<p>
It is we ourselves, the poor, who weld our own chains, who are the cause 
of our own misfortune and that of our loved ones. The old man who extends a 
trembling hand asking for a crumb, the child who cries from cold and hunger, the 
woman who offers her body for a few coins, they are of our making, to us they 
owe their misfortune, because we don’t know enough to make of our chests a 
shield; and our hands, accustomed to begging, are incapable of sinking in, like 
pincers, into the throats of our exploiters.

THE CASSOCK STIRS 
</p>

<p>
Regeneration, September 16, 1911 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
Will someone please tell me when the little priests of San Gabriel, Cali¬ 
fornia became so enamored of the initiator of Mexican political independence, 
Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla? 
</p>

<p>
Don’t these little priests remember that it was the monks, the clerics of 
all stripes who were the fiercest enemies of that noble elder? Don’t these little 
priests in San Gabriel remember that the clergy in Mexico excommunicated Hi¬ 
dalgo? Don’t these little priests remember that the Inquisition degraded, insulted, 
and committed outrages against the martyr of Chihuahua, Miguel Hidalgo y Cos¬ 
tilla? 
</p>

<p>
The clergy has always been the worst enemy of human liberty. So why do 
the clergy now take the name of Hidalgo and bless it, extol it, and even raise altars 
to Hidalgo and call on the simple people to venerate him? 
</p>


<p>
CHAPTER ELEVEN: PHILOSOPHICAL ★ 283 
</p>




<p>
Because the clergy are always hypocrites. If a new idea is broached, there 
you’ll find excommunications and anathemas fulminating. But when the idea tri¬ 
umphs, you’ll see them patronizing it and bragging about being the most disin¬ 
terested defenders of what they were combating yesterday with all the cunning 
at their disposal. The priests condemned Christ, but the doctrines of the martyr 
of Calvary triumphed, and they now have to adore him. But they safeguard them¬ 
selves very well from following his doctrines; they guard themselves well from 
being humble, frugal, and virtuous. They thunder against lust from the pulpit, 
without jeopardizing their keeping of several women; they threaten drunks with 
hellfire, but they wake up every morning with hangovers; they counsel others not 
to rob, but they sell junk in their churches at exorbitant prices. And so on. 
</p>

<p>
Today, the little priests in San Gabriel are celebrating the 16th of Septem¬ 
ber [marking the initiation, by Hidalgo, of Mexico’s war of independence against 
Spain]; and from what I hear it’s simply to increase business. Don’t attend this cel¬ 
ebration, Mexicans. Remember that the monks were the persecutors of Hidalgo; 
remember that the clergy gave full honors to the American invaders in 1847; re¬ 
member that the priests went to Europe to bring to Mexico that poor fool called 
Ferdinand Maximilian Hapsburg.Turn your back on the clergy and join with the 
Partido Liberal Mexicano that wants neither priests, nor authorities, nor the rich.

EARTH 
</p>

<p>
Regeneracion, October 1, 1910 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
At this moment, millions of human beings turn their sad gaze toward the 
heavens, in the hope of finding something beyond the visible stars. This some¬ 
thing is everything, because it constitutes the purpose, it forms the object of this 
painful effort, of this arduous battle of the human species since its first hesitating 
steps put it in advance of the unreasoning species: this thing called happiness. 
</p>

<p>
Happiness! “Happiness is not of this world,” say the religious:“Happiness 
is in the heavens, it’s beyond the grave.”And the human herd raises its eyes, and ig¬ 
norant of the science of the heavens, thinks that this must be very far away when 
</p>


<p>
284 ★ DREAMS OF FREEDOM 
</p>




<p>
its own feet support themselves upon this heavenly body, which with its fellows 
constitutes the glory and the greatness of the firmament. 
</p>

<p>
The Earth forms part of the heavens. Humanity, therefore, is in the heav¬ 
ens. It’s not necessary to gaze upwards in the hope of finding happiness beyond 
those stars that beautify the night: happiness is here, on our own heavenly Earth, 
and it won’t be won through prayers; it won’t be won through orations; it won’t 
be won through begging; nor through humiliations;nor through laments. It’s nec¬ 
essary to fight for it standing and through force, because the gods of the Earth 
aren’t the same as those of the religions, softened by prayers and begging; the 
gods of the Earth have soldiers, they have cops, they have judges, they have hang¬ 
men, they have prisons, they have nooses, they have laws—everything that con¬ 
stitutes what are called institutions, daunting mountains which impede humanity 
from extending its arms and taking possession of the Earth, making it humanity’s 
own, turning it to humanity’s service, making happiness the inheritance of all and 
not the exclusive privilege of the few who today enjoy it. 
</p>

<p>
The Earth is for all. When it formed millions and millions of years ago, 
when it had not separated from the chaos that whirled around forming new suns, 
and later, when this cloud cooled producing new planets, some more some less 
suitable to life, the Earth did not have a master. Neither did it have a master when 
humanity made of every tree trunk in the woods or of each cave in the mountains 
a living space, a refuge from bad weather and wild beasts. Neither did the Earth 
have a master much later when humanity’s painful path arrived in the pastoral pe¬ 
riod: the tribe, which possessed cattle in common, would station itself wherever 
there were pastures.The first master appeared with the first man who took slaves 
to work the fields; and to make himself master of the fields and of the slaves he 
had to use arms in war against an enemy tribe. Violence, then, was the origin of 
landed property, and through violence this property has been maintained to the 
present day. 
</p>

<p>
Invasions, wars of conquest, political revolutions, wars to dominate mar¬ 
kets, the pillage carried out by rulers or their proteges are the source of the titles 
of private property.These titles are sealed with the blood and with the slavery of 
humanity. And the monstrous origin of this absurd “right,” which is based in crime, 
is no obstacle to those who write the laws—in fact, they call it “sacred”—because 
those who write the laws are the same as those who possess the lands. 
</p>

<p>
Landed property 7 is based in crime, and as such is an immoral institution. 
This institution is the fount of all of the ills which afflict humanity. Vice, crime, 
prostitution, despotism are born of it. In order to protect it, these are necessary: 
</p>


<p>
CHAPTER ELEVEN: PHILOSOPHICAL ★ 285 
</p>




<p>
the army, the judiciary, the parliament, the police, the prison, the scaffold, the 
church, the government, and the whole swarm of employed drones, with all of 
them being maintained precisely by those who don’t have a clod of dirt upon 
which to recline their heads, by those who were born when the Earth was al¬ 
ready partitioned up by a few bandits who had appropriated it by force, or when 
it was owned by the descendants of these bandits, who have been possessing it 
under the so-called right of inheritance. 
</p>

<p>
The earth is the principle element in the extraction or production of ev¬ 
erything that is necessary to life.The useful minerals, metals, and materials are ex¬ 
tracted from it: coal, stone, sand, lime, salts. When it’s cultivated, it produces every 
type of nutritious and rare fruit. Its prairies provide food for the cattle, while its 
forests supply their wood, and its springs their beautiful, life-giving waters. And all 
this belongs to a few; it makes happy a few; it gives power to a few, when nature 
made it for all. 
</p>

<p>
From this tremendous injustice are born all of the evils which afflict the 
human species, the evils that produce misery. Misery debases, misery prostitutes, 
misery incites crime, misery bestializes the human face, body, and mind. 
</p>

<p>
Degraded and, what is worse, unaware of their degradation, generations 
pass their lives in the midst of abundance and wealth without tasting the happi¬ 
ness monopolized by a few. With the Earth belonging to a few, those who don’t 
possess it have to rent themselves to those who possess it in order to keep skin 
and bones together.The humiliation of wages or hunger: this is the dilemma that 
private property presents to every human who comes to life. It’s an iron dilemma 
which impels humanity, if it doesn’t want to perish of hunger, to put itself in the 
chains of slavery or turn to crime or prostitution. 
</p>

<p>
Ask yourselves now why the government oppresses, why men rob or 
kill, why women prostitute themselves. Behind all of the bars of those charnel 
houses called prisons, where flesh and spirit rot, thousands of unfortunates pay 
the consequences—the torture of their bodies and the anguish of their spirits— 
of this crime elevated by law as a sacred right: the right of private property. In 
the debasement of bordellos, thousands of young women prostitute their bodies 
and maim their dignity—suffering equally the consequences of private property. 
In the asylums, in the poor houses, in the orphanages, in all of these dark places 
where misery finds refuge, helplessness, hopelessness, and pain are the conse¬ 
quences of private property for men and women, old and young. And the prison¬ 
ers, beggars, prostitutes, orphans, and the sick raise their eyes to the heavens in 
</p>


<p>
286 ★ DREAMS OF FREEDOM 
</p>




<p>
the hope of finding something beyond the visible stars: the happiness which was 
stolen from them by the lords of the Earth. 
</p>

<p>
And the human flock, unconscious of its right to life, bends its back work¬ 
ing for others the earth which nature delivered to it, perpetuating with its submis¬ 
sion the dominion of injustice. 
</p>

<p>
But from the enslaved, muddied masses surge rebels; from a sea of bent 
backs emerge the heads of the first revolutionaries. The flock trembles, fearing 
punishment; tyranny trembles, fearing attack; and, breaking the silence, a cry, 
which sounds like thunder, rolls above the bent backs and arrives at last to the 
thrones: Land! 
</p>

<p>
“Land!” cry the Roman land reformers. “Land!” cry Munzer’s Anabaptists. 
“Land!” Cries Babeuf! “Land!”Cries Bakunin.“Land!” cries Francisco Ferrer.“Land!” 
cries the Mexican revolution. And this cry, smothered a hundred times in blood 
in the course of the ages; this cry, which corresponds to an ideal held lovingly 
through all times by all rebels on the planet; this sacred cry will transport the hu¬ 
man herd to the heavens dreamed of by the mystics in this vale of tears when the 
herd stops looking toward the skies and fixes its gaze here, on this piece of rock 
which is shamed before its celestial brothers by leprous humanity. 
</p>

<p>
Melancholy slaves of the Earth, resigned peons of the fields, throw down 
the plow.The trumpet blasts of Acayucan y Jimenez, of Palomas and Las Vacas, of 
Viesca and Valladolid, call you to war to take possession of the Earth, to which you 
give your sweat, but whose fruits are denied to you, because you have consented 
through your submission to the idle hands which have taken possession of that 
which belongs to you, of that which belongs to humanity as a whole, of that 
which cannot belong to a few men, but rather to all men and all women who, by 
the fact of being alive, have the right to its common enjoyment, through means 
of work—through your submission you have consented to the possession by the 
idle of all the riches which the Earth is capable of producing. 
</p>

<p>
Slaves, take up the rifle! Work the earth only when you’ve taken posses¬ 
sion of it.To work the earth now is to reinforce your chains, because you’ll produce 
more wealth for your bosses, and wealth is power, riches are force, physical and 
moral, and the strong will always hold you in subjugation. Be strong yourselves; let 
all be strong and become the masters of the Earth. But for this the gun is needed. 
Buy it, ask someone to lend one to you as a last resort, and launch yourselves into 
the struggle crying with all your heart: Land and Liberty!

CANNON FODDER 
</p>

<p>
Regeneration, October 15, 1910 
</p>

<p>
(Translation by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
It’s the hour to reflect. For centuries and centuries the task of thinking, of 
studying, of reflecting, has been the task of the so-called ruling classes of society: 
the rich and the intellectuals.The masses haven’t thought, and, naturally enough, 
those who have done it for them have been well paid for this “service,” done 
contrary to the interests of the multitude. But the moment to reflect has arrived. 
The moment has arrived to decide whether the poor will continue under the self- 
interested direction of the rich or if we’ll bravely take charge of the study of our 
problems and entrust in ourselves the defense of our interests. Now is the time to 
do it. Let us choose: let us be either an easily led flock or a phalanx of conscious 
beings: shame or glory. 
</p>

<p>
Dragged along by the interests of the ruling classes, the proletarian mass¬ 
es have shed their blood throughout the ages.There has always been discontent 
among the poor, discontent occasioned by misery and injustice, by hunger and 
oppression. At the same time, the proletariat has always been disposed to rebel 
in the hope of attaining an improvement in its conditions. But being proletarians 
they haven’t thought with their heads; rather, it’s the ruling classes that have 
thought for them: it’s the ruling classes who have channeled the tendencies in 
insurrectionary movements. And they have been the only ones who have taken 
advantage of the sacrifices of the working class. 
</p>

<p>
Look then, workers, how important it is that you undertake on your own 
count the conquest of your own well-being. Every time that the ruling classes 
need the force of numbers to ensure a victory beneficial to themselves, they go to 
the proletariat, to the masses always disposed toward rebellion; they are certain 
of finding heroes in the mob that they cordially despise, but who at the time of 
need they adulate.They will praise the passions and even applaud and stimulate 
the vices of their dupes, as if passing the hand over the back of a beast in order to 
tame it with kindness when it’s not necessary to employ the whip. 
</p>

<p>
In this manner the proletarian masses have been hurled into war, have 
been pushed into committing acts contrary to their own interests. Wars of con¬ 
quest, wars of commerce, wars of colonialism, political insurrections—all have 
been waged with the blood of proletarians, who are wildly applauded while they 
live their lives as heroes, and who are scorned and spit upon after the victory 
</p>


<p>
290 ★ DREAMS OF FREEDOM 
</p>




<p>
when it’s necessary that someone sows grain, takes care of the cattle, makes 
clothing, builds houses. Then the heroes are kicked off the pedestal erected for 
them by the ruling classes and forced to return to their work in the fields, the 
workshops, the factories, the mines, the railways, each of them carrying, as if a 
prize, a paper, an official declaration of their valor, and a copper medal that shines 
upon their rags on holidays—plus some physical scars as well as the bad habits 
they picked up from their days in the barracks. Meanwhile, the rich and the intel¬ 
lectuals split up the lands of the conquered country. And in the nation whose 
government won via the sacrifice of the common people, they’ll squander the 
copious booty seized from the vanquished by the plebeian army. 
</p>

<p>
And this has been repeated since time immemorial; those below are al¬ 
ways swindled, made the butt of a joke, and those above always win, without the 
experience opening the eyes of the flock—without the great swindle, constantly 
repeated, making the masses revolt, without even making them think.The present 
crowd is the same crowd that, inflamed and innocent, carried the great captains 
of antiquity on its shoulders: the crowd of Alexander, the rabble of Cyrus, the ple¬ 
beians of Cambises, the flock of Scipio, the multitudes of Hannibal, the barbarians 
of Attila, all of them thought the same as the Napoleonic mobs, the conquering 
rabble of the Transvaal, the American plebes of Santiago and Cavite, and the trium¬ 
phant yellow legions in Manchuria.The psychology of the contemporary masses 
is the same as that of the French masses in 1789, of the masses of Hidalgo in 1810, 
of the republican masses of Portugal today. It’s always the same: the sacrifice of 
well-intentioned proletarians to the benefit of the ruling classes; the suffering and 
pain of the humble to the benefit of the intellectuals and the rich. 
</p>

<p>
This has all been because the proletarians have not had the purpose of 
channeling popular movements toward the goal of their own best interests, but 
rather have obeyed the orders of the dominating minority that, as is natural, has 
always worked in the interests of itself. So, for example, in wars of conquest, in 
commercial and colonial wars, wars that the government of one nation has car¬ 
ried out against the people of another in order to extend its territorial domain or 
to conquer markets that will consume the industrial or agricultural products of 
the aggressing nation, the proletariat has done nothing other than give its blood 
to obtain, in exchange, no material benefitThe great industrialists, the great finan¬ 
ciers, the great bankers and the men in government are those who benefit from 
these wars. To the proletariat nothing remains but the glory, if it’s possible that 
murder on a grand scale committed against foreign peoples, to satisfy the absurd 
greed of the kings of industry, banks, and commerce, provides glory. Are the Brit¬ 
ish workers happier today after the triumph of British arms in the Transvaal? Are 
</p>


<p>
CHAPTER TWELVE: WAR ★ 291 
</p>




<p>
the American workers happier as a result of the triumph of the U.S. Army over the 
Spanish army? Do the Japanese today enjoy more comforts than before Japan’s 
triumph over Russia? No, not a bit of it. The British, Americans, and the Japanese 
continue being confronted with the same social problems as before, aggravated 
even more by the increase in the power of the ruling class provided by the acqui¬ 
sition of new markets. 
</p>

<p>
And in regard to revolutions, one can observe the same result. Acts per¬ 
formed solely to obtain political liberty, triumphs obtained with the blood of the 
proletarian masses, have left the workers enslaved just as they were before they 
shed their blood. Our own history provides sufficient examples to prove this great 
truth, which could appear as blasphemy to those who don’t probe deeply enough 
to get to the bottom of things, to those conservators of political institutions al¬ 
ready fallen in deep disgrace. The insurrection of 1810, which gave us political 
independence, didn’t have the power to give, to a people hungry for bread and 
education, that which was necessary for their elevation, and this was because the 
proletariat didn’t decide to undertake its own redemption, to channel the move¬ 
ment led by the martyr Miguel Hidalgo toward an end that would benefit the 
working class. The insurrection against Santa Anna, initiated in Ayutla, and which 
had as its result the promulgation of the Constitution of 1857, likewise didn’t 
have the power to deliver bread and education to the people. As is well known, 
it provided political liberties, but these were only taken advantage of by those 
who occupied prominent places in the political and social life of the country, 
but not by the proletarians who, because of their lack of money, education, and 
even social status, found themselves totally subordinated to the will of the ruling 
classes. Again, the proletariat derived no benefit from the movement initiated in 
Ayutla because it didn’t make the decision to channel the rebellion toward a prac¬ 
tical end, that of benefitting itself. The insurrection of Tuxtepec, which dragged 
the people behind the banner of “Real Suffrage and No Re-election,” reconquered 
for the masses the choosing of alternatives via popular election, and had as its re¬ 
sult the despotism that today we suffer in the political terrain and in the increased 
misery and misfortune of the working people, because the working class didn’t 
take charge of the revolutionary movement of Porfirio Diaz and instead entrusted 
its future to the ruling classes of society. 
</p>

<p>
Now, a new revolution is brewing. The excesses of Diaz’s tyranny have 
injured all, both proletarians and non-proletarians, both men and women, both 
old and young. Political power has been monopolized and held in very few hands, 
and many members of the ruling classes have seen themselves obligated to allow 
</p>


<p>
292 ★ DREAMS OF FREEDOM 
</p>




<p>
the power they held under former governments to remain in the few hands [of 
the Diaz clique]; these individuals, naturally, have undertaken to work toward re¬ 
capturing their former power. As always, these members of the ruling classes go 
down to the proletariat now that they need the force of numbers, and they caress 
it, extol it, they put in play the traditional scam of applauding it to the point of 
numbness; in the end, they pass their hand over the back of the monster in order 
to entice it with sweetness, without in any way hindering their ability to make 
the slavery harder in the haciendas, more arduous and less remunerative in the 
factories, workshops, and mines the day after the victory achieved through the 
blood, sacrifice, and heroism of the proletarian masses. 
</p>

<p>
Proletarians: this is the hour to reflect.The revolutionary movement can¬ 
not be detained; it must, naturally, explode because of the forces producing it. But 
there’s no reason to fear this movement. It’s best to desire it and even to bring it 
about. It’s better to die for honor, better to die defending the future of our fami¬ 
lies, than to continue suffering, in the midst of peace, the affront of slavery, the 
shame of misery and ignorance. But, comrades, don’t let the so-called directing 
classes do your thinking for you and don’t let them organize the revolution in 
such a way as to favor their interests. Take an active part in the great movement 
which is going to break out, and make sure that it takes the direction necessary 
so that this time if benefits the working class. Go over the pages of history, and in 
them you will find that in armed struggles in which the ruling classes have taken 
part,your role has always been that of cannon fodder, for the simple reason that 
you didn’t want to go to the pain of thinking with your own heads and of under¬ 
taking the task of your own redemption. Remember that the emancipation of the 
working class must be the task of the workers themselves, and that this emancipa¬ 
tion will begin with taking possession of the earth. Get ready, then, for the great 
revolution; but carry with you the purpose of taking the earth, of yanking it from 
the claws of those who now hold it for themselves. Only by doing so will you not 
be cannon fodder, but rather heroes who will know how to respect yourselves, 
in the midst of revolution and after the triumph, because you will have, through 
only the acquisition of the land, the power necessary to achieve, with little more 
effort,your total liberation. 
</p>

<p>
Bear in mind, once again, that a simple change of rulers is not a fount of 
liberty, and that any revolutionary program that doesn’t contain a clause concern¬ 
ing the taking of the lands by the people is a program of the ruling classes, who 
will never struggle against their own interests, as history has shown, and who 
only go to the masses, the plebeians, the rabble, when they need heroes to defend

<p>
them and to sacrifice themselves for them—heroes who a few hours after the 
triumph will see themselves with their flanks bloodied by the spurs of the bosses 
who ride them. 
</p>

<p>
Proletarians: take in hand the gun and gather behind the banner of the 
Partido Liberal, which is the only one which invites you to take possession of the 
earth for yourselves.

TO THE SOLDIERS 
</p>

<p>
Regeneration, April 18, 1914 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
To be a soldier is to be a machine, and to be a machine is degrading to a 
human being; to command is bad; to obey is worse. 
</p>

<p>
Soldier of Huerta or soldier of Carranza, these are two machines that re¬ 
ally are the same, because the two do the same thing: kill to keep some bandit in 
power who defends the interests of the capitalist class. 
</p>

<p>
The first duty of a soldier is to obey his superiors. His superiors! An hon¬ 
orable man should prefer to be dead rather than to renounce his dignity by con¬ 
sidering another man his superior. 
</p>

<p>
Superior! And why is this doll dressed in a manner that would shame 
a sensible man superior? Superior! How can a marionette be superior simply 
because he drags around a sword and adorns himself with shiny ribbons like a 
circus clown? 
</p>

<p>
No. These presumptuous fools can’t be superior. These little officials, 
these little chieftains aren’t superior to the common soldiers.These,the so-called 
superiors, eat, sleep, etc., like any other mortal.They’re flesh and blood like the 
soldier; they’re born, they grow up, and they die, like the soldier. Where does 
the “superiority” of these ridiculous men come from? Perhaps they know better 
than the soldier the undignified art of killing; but the soldier, proletarian that he 
is, knows how to plow the field, sow the grain, gather the harvest, tend the rails 
for the trains, go to the bottom of the mine for precious metals, weave the cloth, 
make the clothing, build the houses. In a word, he knows how to do everything, 
and everything that exists has come from his creative proletarian hands; and that

<p>
which makes life agreeable or at least less hard is owed to him, to the proletarian, 
the true master of the Earth. 
</p>

<p>
The soldier shouldn’t consider any man his superior. All men are equal, 
and it’s shameful to subordinate oneself to the will of another. The duty of a sol¬ 
dier is to kill—as if dealing with poisonous vermin—all those who consider them¬ 
selves superior to him. 
</p>

<p>
And so,death to all“superiors”! 
</p>


<p>
THE WORLD WAR 
</p>

<p>
Regeneracion, November 14, 1914 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
The size of Regeneracion is so small that, sadly, we cannot give a detailed 
account of the tremendous conflict in which the principal world powers are in¬ 
volved . 
</p>

<p>
We can only say that the war will continue on its course of destruction, 
mourning, blood, flames, tears, and that every day there are more expectations 
that other nations will become dragged into this struggle for industrial and com¬ 
mercial supremacy by their respective bourgeois classes. 
</p>

<p>
How many have died in the present conflict? If one said that a million 
workers have died, that would be a low estimate of the number of lives lost. But 
let’s suppose that the number lost in this evil war is a million; this would signify 
that a million families find themselves without protection because their men were 
so stupid that they preferred to march to the slaughterhouse to defend the inter¬ 
ests of their exploiters rather than to go to war in defense of the interests of their 
class. 
</p>

<p>
That such lambs die is a good thing.There’s no lack of men who are ob¬ 
stacles to the desire for liberty of the other individuals of their class. When our 
own die, we should cry. When imbeciles die fighting for the glory of their own 
exploiters, we should laugh: that means we’ll encounter fewer obstacles in our 
struggle for the destruction of the present system. 
</p>

<p>
The men who are dying on the battlefields of the world’s bourgeoisie 
won’t be missed by humanity. They are an obstacle to the development of the 
</p>


<p>
CHAPTER TWELVE: WAR ★ 295 
</p>




<p>
world s peoples; they are the ballast that must be painfully carried by the revo¬ 
lutionaries; they are the ones who laugh to themselves when we tell them it’s 
necessary to do away with all tyrannies; they are the ones who insult us when we 
tell them that all human beings are equal; they are the ones who believe in social 
superiority. Let them die! Blessed be the war that saves us the labor of cutting 
such throats! 
</p>

<p>
To cry because such men die is stupid; to lament that thousands and 
thousands of families are without protection because their kinsmen have per¬ 
ished in this clash of bandits is a weakness. Humanity needs this type of bloodlet¬ 
ting, this discarding of the bad so that the healthy part can prosper. 
</p>

<p>
Let us hope that governments and the bourgeoisie will be weakened by 
this stupid war, and that this will facilitate our triumph.The good should flee this 
war and prepare themselves for the one to come: the class war. This will be the 
holy war. 
</p>

<p>
Upon seeing weepy articles in various periodicals about this war, one 
feels as if one s nerves were rubbed raw.These aren’t our brothers who are per¬ 
ishing by the thousands on the battlefields of Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania. 
They are our enemies; they are those who want this system which holds us in 
contempt to survive; they are the lackeys of capital, the church, and authority. 
</p>

<p>
What we revolutionaries should do is wait and be ready for the oppor¬ 
tune moment to unleash our fists against our oppressors. We’ll continue to follow 
the course of this war with interest. We have our hand over the heart of the bour¬ 
geois system, and when we feel its pulsations weaken we won’t vacillate. We’ll 
finish it off! 
</p>

<p>
A better opportunity will not be presented to the true revolutionaries of 
the entire world than this crazy, suicidal war; it offers the opportunity for us to 
unite our forces and to coordinate our plans. We can’t lose such a great opportu¬ 
nity; we can’t permit the governments weakened by this conflict to revive. 
</p>

<p>
Don’t cry.The sheep who suffer on the battlefields of the bourgeoisie are 
a threat to our liberty while they are alive. Dead, they’re a guarantee of victory for 
the interests of our class. 
</p>

<p>
Long live Land and Liberty!

THE WAR 
</p>

<p>
Regeneracion, April 21, 1917 
</p>


<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
The U.S. government has declared war on Germany and has placed the 
American people at the center of the great world catastrophe. 
</p>

<p>
The principle that the government has invoked to drag the people into 
the abyss couldn’t be more attractive: liberty. 
</p>

<p>
Liberty. What evil cause hasn’t covered itself with that mantle to seduce 
the public? The tyrant oppresses in its name; invoking it, the executioner chops 
off the head of his victim; the law crushes in its behalf; and as a guarantee of its 
benefits the military barracks are raised and the prison constructed. 
</p>

<p>
In the name of liberty the bourgeoisie has been permitted to suck the 
blood of the people; in the name of liberty the priest stupefies the masses; the 
system of private property lives in the name of liberty 
</p>

<p>
In what manner does the great European conflict threaten the liberties of 
the American people? Whether the allies triumph or whether the central powers 
triumph, to whichever side would come the victory, the American people would 
have continued being the unarmed and humiliated victims of the rich, the priest, 
and the ruler, but with the advantage of not having lost a drop of blood in that 
stupid conflict.Whereas once dragged to war it won’t matter to which side comes 
victory, because the people will continue to suffer the same evils, aggravated to 
infinity by the natural consequences of all struggles undertaken in pursuit of nar¬ 
row interests. 
</p>

<p>
The European conflict doesn’t threaten the liberty of the American peo¬ 
ple, but rather the liberty to steal granted to the bourgeoisie. The vigorous Ger¬ 
man submarine warfare campaign is a formidable obstacle to the free exercise of 
robbery on a grand scale practiced by the American bourgeoisie under the name 
of commerce.The German submarine campaign hasn’t threatened the American 
people, but rather the manufacturers of arms and munitions and the food export¬ 
ers. The American people would have benefitted from a resurgence of the subma¬ 
rine campaign, because the foodstuffs exported to Europe would have remained 
here, lowering the price of food. 
</p>

<p>
A government that concerned itself with the well-being of the people 
would have given its blessing to the resurgence of the submarine campaign that 
impeded the export of foodstuffs. But when has there been the miracle of a gov- 
</p>


<p>
CHAPTER TWELVE: WAR ★ 297 
</p>




<p>
ernment that concerns itself with the well-being of the masses? All governments 
have as their first duty the protection of the interests of the bourgeoisie, and the 
American government, faithful to this duty, declared war on Germany in the name 
of liberty &#x2026; the liberty to rob. 
</p>

<p>
It can be seen clearly enough that this declaration of war hasn’t been 
made to benefit the American people, but rather to benefit their exploiters: the 
rich. And to benefit their exploiters, these poor people will have to shed their 
blood in the trenches, be smothered with enormous taxes to offset the costs of 
the war, will suffer the most extreme misery, and will lose, under the iron rule of 
militarist legislation, the last crumbs of liberty permitted them by their bosses so 
that they can dream of themselves being free and sovereign. 
</p>

<p>
The date on which Woodrow Wilson signed the declaration of war 
opened a black period for the inhabitants of this country. Persecutions are be¬ 
coming more frequent; all foreigners are viewed with suspicion; every German is 
seen as a spy; sentries open fire upon the first suspicious person who approaches 
an arsenal, a bridge, a munitions factory, a tunnel, or a fort; the jails are overflowing 
with spies or suspected spies; the muzzle upon the press has been made stronger; 
and in the offices of the great men methods are studied of how to recruit an army 
of two million men, that is, of two million proletarians ripped from the arms of 
their families in order to defend the interests of the rich. 
</p>

<p>
Forward! The American people will have to convince themselves that all 
government is bad and that there will only be peace in the world when the so- 
called right of private property has disappeared. 
</p>

<p>
The peoples are accustomed to walking with their eyes closed, and it’s 
not a bad thing that they stumble now and then so that they’ll open their eyes.

<p>
THE BOURGEOIS COUNTRY AND THE UNIVERSAL 
COUNTRY 
</p>

<p>
Speech, September 19, 1915 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
Humanity finds itself in one of the most solemn moments in its history. 
Nothing in the universe is stable, everything changes. We find ourselves in the 
moment in which a change is occurring in &#x2026; the manner in which human beings 
affiliate themselves to the conjunction of economic, political, social, moral and 
religious institutions that is called the capitalist system, or the system of private or 
individual property. 
</p>

<p>
The capitalist system is dying of self-inflicted wounds, and humanity, 
astonished, is witnessing the impressive suicide. It’s not the workers who have 
dragged the nations into falling upon one another; it’s the bourgeoisie itself which 
has provoked the conflict in its zeal to dominate all of the markets.The German 
bourgeoisie has made colossal strides in industry and commerce, and the English 
bourgeoisie felt jealous of its rival. This is what’s at the bottom of this conflict 
that’s called the European War: the jealousy of peddlers, the enemy status of traf¬ 
fickers, the quarrels of adventurers. On the battlefields of Europe, the honor of a 
people, a race, or a country is not at issue; rather, what’s in dispute, in this struggle 
of wild beasts, is everyone’s pocketbook: they are hungry wolves trying to snatch 
away a prize. We’re not dealing with wounded national honor nor with an insult 
to the flag, but with a struggle for position by the monied interests, monied inter¬ 
ests which first made the people sweat in the fields, factories, mines, in all of the 
places of exploitation, and that now want these same exploited people to guard 
with their lives the pockets of those who rob them. 
</p>

<p>
What sarcasm! What bloody irony! First the people are made to work 
for a crumb while the bosses retain the profits, and then the people are made 
to destroy each other in order that these profits aren’t yanked from the claws 
of their exploiters. For we the poor to protect ourselves is good; this is our duty, 
it’s an obligation imposed on us by solidarity. For us to protect one another, to 
aid each other, to defend ourselves mutually, is a necessity which we must satisfy 
if we don’t want to be annihilated by our bosses. But to arm ourselves and fall 
upon each other to defend the pocketbooks of our bosses is a crime of the first 
order; it’s a felony which we should indignantly refuse to commit. Taking up arms 
is good—but against the enemies of our class, against the bourgeoisie; and if our 
</p>


<p>
CHAPTER TWELVE: WAR ★ 299 
</p>




<p>
arms have to cave in some heads, let them be those of the rich; if our daggers 
have to pierce some hearts, let them be those of the bourgeoisie. But we the poor 
should not destroy one another. 
</p>

<p>
On the battlefields of Europe, the poor destroy one another to the benefit 
of the rich, who have made the poor believe that they are fighting for the benefit 
of their country. Well then, what country does the poor man have? He can’t count 
on more than his arms to make a living, a living which he’ll lack if the accursed 
boss doesn’t want to exploit him.What country does he have?The country ought 
to be like a good mother who shelters equally all of her children. What shelter do 
the poor have in their respective countries? None! The poor man is a slave in all 
nations; he’s a wretch in all of them; he’s a martyr under all governments.The na¬ 
tions don’t give bread to the hungry; they don’t console the sad; they don’t wipe 
the sweat from the face of the worker done in by fatigue; they don’t interpose 
themselves between the weak and the strong to protect the weak from abuse. But 
when the interests of the rich are in danger, then they’ll call on the poor to give 
up their lives for their country, the country of the rich, for a country that isn’t 
theirs, but that belongs to their exploiters. 
</p>

<p>
Open your eyes brothers in chains and exploitation; open your eyes to 
the light of reason.The nation is for those who possess it, and the poor possess 
nothing.The nation is the doting mother of the rich and the neglectful stepmoth¬ 
er of the poor. The nation is the cop armed with a club who kicks us, hurling us 
to the floor of a jail or who puts a rope around our necks when we don’t want to 
obey the laws written by the rich for the benefit of the rich.The nation is not our 
mother; it’s our scourge! 
</p>

<p>
And to defend this scourge, our proletarian brothers of Europe have 
snuffed each other out of existence, one by the other. Imagine the space occu¬ 
pied by over 6,000,000 bodies—a mountain of cadavers, rivers of blood and tears; 
this is what the European war has produced to this moment. And these dead are 
our class brothers, the flesh of our flesh and the blood of our blood. They are 
workers who from childhood were taught to love the bourgeois country, in order 
that come the day they would allow themselves to be killed for it. What do these 
heroes own in their countries? Nothing! They possess nothing more than a pair 
of strong arms with which to make a living for themselves and their families. Now 
the widows, those grieving these workers, will have to die of hunger.The women 
will prostitute themselves in order to lift a piece of bread to their mouths; the 
children will steal in order to bring something to eat to their old parents; the sick 
will go to the hospital and to the tomb. Whorehouse, prison, hospital, miserable 
</p>

<p>
death: we have here the prize which the heirs of the heroes who died for their 
country will receive. Meanwhile the rich and the rulers will carouse, squandering 
the gold they’ve made the people sweat for in the factories, workshops, and in the 
mines.What a contrast! Sacrifice, pain, tears for all those who produce, for the self- 
denying creators of wealth. Pleasures and good fortune for the lazy who ride on 
our shoulders.We must shake ourselves, we must agitate ourselves, we must work 
so that the parasites who are putting an end to our existence fall to our feet. Let’s 
resolutely place our hands around the neck of the enemy. We’re stronger than he 
is. A revolutionary speaks this great truth: “The great appear great only because

<p>
Well then, as horrible as the senseless butchery is that converts the old 
world into a slaughterhouse, it has to produce immense benefits for humanity, and 
in place of delivering ourselves to sad reflections thinking only of the pain, the 
tears, and the blood, we should recognize that such a great slaughter had to take 
place. The people, degraded by bourgeois civilization, haven’t realized that they 
have rights, which has made such a great shakeup indispensable to waking them 
up to the reality of things.There are many who need pain to open their minds to 
reason. Mistreatment makes vile the humble and timid, but in the chest of a man, 
sentiments of dignity and noble pride are awakened by being shamed, and these 
feelings make him rebel. Hunger brings the coward to his knees and he delivers 
himself kneeling to the rich; but at the same time it’s a spur to the people to rise 
up. Suffering can lead to patience and resignation, but it can also put the dagger, 
bomb, and revolver in the hands of the valiant. And this will be what will happen 
when this vile war ends, or it is what will make it end. The great battles in the 
trenches will end on the barricade and with the mutinies of the rebelling people, 
and the national flags will fall, giving place to the red banner of all the disinherited 
of the world. 
</p>

<p>
Then the revolution which was born in Mexico, and which lives still as a 
whip and punishment for those who exploit, those who swindle, and those who 
oppress humanity, will extend its cleansing flames throughout the entire Earth, 
and in place of proletarian heads the heads of the rich, rulers, and priests will roll, 
and a single cry will escape from the breasts of millions and millions of human 
beings: Long live Land and Liberty! 
</p>

<p>
And for the first time the sun will not be ashamed of sending its glorious 
rays to this melancholy Earth, now glorified by a new humanity, more just, more 
wise; all of the lands on Earth will become a single large, beautiful, good country: 
</p>


<p>
CHAPTER TWELVE: WAR ★ 301 
</p>




<p>
the country of human beings, the country of the man and the woman, with a 
single flag: that of universal fraternity. 
</p>

<p>
We salute, comrades of hardships and ideals, the Mexican Revolution.We 
salute this sublime epoch of the peon becoming a free man through rebellion, 
and we put everything we have, our money, our talents, our energy, our good will, 
and if necessary we’ll sacrifice our well-being, our liberty, and even our lives in 
order that the revolution does not terminate in the elevation of any man to power, 
but rather, continuing its redemptive path, terminates with the abolition of the 
right of private property and the death of the principle of authority, because 
while there are men who possess and men who have nothing, well-being and lib¬ 
erty will be a dream; they will continue only as a pretty, never realized illusion. 
</p>

<p>
The revolution should not be the means by which the wicked elevate 
themselves, but rather a movement for justice which gives the death blow to mis¬ 
ery and tyranny, things which will not end through the election of rulers, but that 
will end with the abolition of the so-called right of private property. This “right” is 
the cause of all of the evils that humanity suffers.There’s no reason to search for 
the origin of our ills in any other place; because of the “right” of private property 
there are governments and there are priests.The government is entrusted to see 
that the rich are not dispossessed by the poor, and the priests have no other mis¬ 
sion than to infuse in the hearts of proletarians patience, resignation, and the fear 
of God, so that they never think of rebelling against their tyrants and exploiters. 
</p>

<p>
The Partido Liberal Mexicano—a revolutionary union of workers—un¬ 
derstands that liberty and well-being are impossible while capitalism, authority, 
and the clergy exist, and to the death of these three monsters, or this monster 
with three heads, the PLM directs all of its efforts; and to the propaganda and to 
the actions of the members of this party we owe the fact that there is no stable 
government in Mexico, that is, that a new tyranny has not consolidated itself. We 
don’t want the rich, nor rulers, nor priests; we don’t want idlers who exploit the 
efforts of laborers; we don’t want bandits who sustain these idlers via the law; nor 
do we want evildoers who, in the name of whatever religion, make the poor into 
sheep who, without resistance or complaint, allow themselves to be devoured by 
wolves. 
</p>

<p>
Those of you who want to investigate to the bottom what the Partido 
Liberal Mexicano fights for need do nothing other than read the manifesto of 
September 23,1911, issued by the organizing junta of the party. 
</p>

<p>
As the European war is a necessary evil, the Mexican Revolution is a 
blessing. That there is blood, that there are tears, that there are sacrifices is cer-

<p>
tain; but what great conquest has ever been obtained amid parties and pleasures? 
Liberty is the greatest conquest which a dignified breast can hope for, and liberty 
can only be obtained by facing death, misery, and prison. 
</p>

<p>
To think that there is any other way of winning liberty is to sadly fool 
</p>

<p>
oneself. 
</p>

<p>
Our liberty is in the hands of our oppressors; and we can’t get it from 
them without sacrifice. 
</p>

<p>
Forward! If in Europe they’re still fighting for “their country,” that is, for 
the rich, in Mexico the fight is for Land and Liberty! Forward! The moment is sol¬ 
emn. In Mexico tne capitalist system is crumbling unuu unjvva L/i uiw xi\jiL/iv, 
plebeian, and the outcry of the rich and the clergy arrives in Washington, upset¬ 
ting the mind of that poor puppet of the bourgeoisie called Woodrow Wilson, 
the dwarf president, the functionary in a farce who, through the irony of fate, has 
been touched to be an actor in a tragedy in which the only ones who should take 
part are men of iron. 
</p>

<p>
Forward! The remedy is within our grasp.To put an end to the capitalist 
system we don’t need to do anything other than put our hands upon the goods 
held by the claws of the rich and declare them the property of all, men and wom¬ 
en alike. A man risks his life to elevate someone to be a ruler, and however much 
a friend of the poor that ruler is said to be, he’ll never be more of a friend to the 
poor than he is to the rich, because his job is to see that the law is respected, and 
the law orders that the right of private or individual property be respected. Why 
should one kill oneself to have a government? Why not, rather, sacrifice oneself 
not to have one? There’s better reason to do so, because, with the same effort 
required to kick one ruler out and put another in his place, one could snatch the 
wealth from the hands of the rich. 
</p>

<p>
Expropriation: this is the remedy—but it must be expropriation for the 
benefit of all and not the benefit of only a few. Expropriation is the golden key 
which will open the gates of liberty, because the possession of wealth gives eco¬ 
nomic independence. He who doesn’t need to rent his arms in order to live is 
free. 
</p>

<p>
Forward! It is not possible to sit and be simple spectators to this formi¬ 
dable drama. Let everyone unite with those of his class: the poor with the poor, 
the rich with the rich, so that everyone finds himself with his own and in his 
proper place for the final battle: that of the poor against the rich, that of the op¬ 
pressed against the oppressors, that of the hungry against the well fed; and when 
the smoke of the final gunshot has dissipated, and the bourgeois edifice no longer

has stone resting on stone, the sun will shine on our ennobled faces and the Earth 
will feel the pride of being trodden on by men and not by flocks. 
</p>

<p>
We must learn something from our revolutionary, expropriating brothers 
in Mexico.They haven’t waited for someone to elevate himself to the presidency 
of the republic to initiate the era of justice. As men, they have destroyed every¬ 
thing that was in the way of redemptory action. Real revolutionaries, they have 
smashed the law to pieces—the law, the underhanded support of injustice; the 
law, the pimp for the strong. With strong hands they have broken to pieces the 
jail bars, and with the heavy bars they’ve sunk in the craniums of the judges and 
pen pushers.They’ve caressed the necks of the bourgeoisie with the rope of the 
noose and, with a heroic face not seen for centuries, they have put their hands 
upon the earth, which has palpitated emotionally upon feeling itself possessed by 
free men. 
</p>

<p>
Forward! Let everyone in this solemn moment do his duty.

Long live anarchy! Long live the Partido Liberal Mexicano! Long live Land 
and Liberty!

<p>
PEDRO’S DREAM 
</p>

<p>
Regeneration, May 4, 1912 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by M.V.) 
</p>

<p>
Sitting on the threshold of the doorway to his humble abode, Pedro, the 
robust and spirited day laborer thinks, thinks, thinks. He has just read Regener¬ 
ation », which a thin, nervous, intelligent-looking worker had given him yesterday 
as he was returning home. He has never read this newspaper, though he has heard 
people talk of it, sometimes with scorn or anger, other times with enthusiasm. 
</p>

<p>
Sitting on the threshold of his doorway, Pedro thinks, thinks, thinks, and 
within his skull revolves, until it fills his body with physical malaise, this simple 
question: how will it be possible to live without government? Pedro accepts ev¬ 
erything, everything, except that one could live without government, and, feeling 
his head burn, he stands up and begins to wander aimlessly, while the question 
repeats torturously within his skull: How will it be possible to live without gov¬ 
ernment? 
</p>

<p>
It is eight in the morning on the final day of April. The roses open their 
petals, allowing the sun to kiss them.The hens keep busy, scratching the earth in 
search of worms while the gallant roosters sweep their wings around them, look¬ 
ing for love. Pedro walks and walks, the fronds of the palm trees sway beneath the 
luminous sky, the swallows haul mud for building their nests; Tcdro finds himself 
surrounded by fields; the cattle pace tranquilly, without needing a policeman to 
beat them; the rabbits frolic without need of legislators to pass laws that will 
make them happy, the hummingbirds enjoy the blessing of life, without having 
among them one that says:“I am in charge; obey me!” 
</p>

<p>
Pedro feels as if he has been freed from a massive weight and exclaims, 
“Yes, it is possible to live without government! ” The spectacle of animal life has 
given him the answer, and the question has ceased bouncing around inside his 
skull.The herds he sees before him do not need a government to be able to live. 
Without private property, there is no need for anyone to guard this property from 
the attacks of those who possess nothing.They possess, in common, the beautiful 
prairie and the crystalline water, and, when the sun furiously casts down its rays, 
they share, in common, the shadows projected by the trees. Without government, 
those dignified animals do not smash each other to bits, nor do they need judges, 
nor jailers, nor hangmen, nor policemen. Without private property, there is not 
this dreadful rivalry, this cruel war of one class against the other, of one individual

<p>
against the other, that weakens the feeling of solidarity, which is so powerful 
among animals of the same species. 
</p>

<p>
Pedro fills his lungs with a deep breath; a vast horizon is opening before 
him, as his intelligence perceives crumbling down before it the black scaffolding 
of prejudices, biases, and primitive myths that bourgeois society has so carefully 
fomented in order to perpetuate its existence. Pedro had been taught that it is es¬ 
sential that there be masters and servants, rich and poor, governors and governed. 
Now he understands it all: those who are interested in the continued existence of 
the present political, economic, and social system are those who are determined

beings. 
</p>

<p>
Pedro thinks, thinks, thinks.The coyotes, the wolves, the ducks, the wild 
horses, the buffalo, the elephants, the ants, the sparrows, the swallows, the doves, 
and almost all other animals live socially, and their societies are based on a solidar¬ 
ity practiced on a level that the poor human species still has not reached, despite 
the discoveries made by science.This has caused humanity to be absolutely done 
in by the existence of private property rights, which permit the strongest, the 
smartest, and the wickedest to hoard, for their exclusive benefit, natural resources 
and the products of human labor, denying the others their rightful social inheri¬ 
tance and subjecting them to working for a crust when they have the right to 
take the whole loaf. 
</p>

<p>
The midday sun rains down like lead, and Pedro takes refuge under a tree 
and falls asleep.The insects flit around and around his head, like jewels escaping 
from a jewelry store, eager to glitter in the sun. 
</p>

<p>
Pedro sleeps and dreams. He dreams of an open field where thousands of 
his fellow men work the land, while from their throats spring the triumphal notes 
of a hymn to Work and Freedom. Never before has anyone conceived of such a 
melody. Never before has anyone felt so free and so fortunate to be alive! Pedro 
works and sings with the others, and, at the end of several hours, which pass like 
seconds, the joyful workers embark on the journey back to their village, where 
pretty little homes, surrounded by gardens, lacking nothing needed to make life 
pleasant and beautiful, welcome them. All of the homes have hot and cold water, 
electrical outlets, electric stoves, bathrooms, washrooms, comfortable furniture, 
curtains, carpets, pianos, and pantries jam-packed with supplies. Pedro, like every¬ 
one else, has a house and lives happily with his partner and their children. Nobody 
works for wages anymore. Everyone owns everything.Those who are inclined to 
do agricultural work join together to work in the fields, those who are inclined 
to do factory work join together with their brothers, and ultimately everyone 
</p>


<p>

<p>
from all industries join together, reaching agreements about how to produce ac¬ 
cording to the needs of the community, putting the products of all the industries 
into a vast common warehouse from which all the working population can draw 
freely. Each takes what he needs, for there is an abundance of everything. There 
is neither a beggar nor a prostitute to be seen on the streets because the needs 
of all people are satisfied. Among the workers an elderly person cannot be seen, 
because they worked when they were capable, and they now live tranquilly from 
the work of younger strong men, awaiting a tranquil death surrounded by those 
who love them; the disabled enjoy the same privilege as the elderly. 
</p>

<p>
To achieve this, the inhabitants of this region began by refusing to rec¬ 
ognize all authority, while declaring the land and the means of production to be 
common property.The workers of each industry gathered together to discuss the 
way to proceed with production, having at hand statistics detailing the stockpiles 
in the warehouses of the bourgeoisie, and which are now located in a vast ware¬ 
house available to all. 
</p>

<p>
Many unnecessary industries have been eliminated now that no one is in¬ 
terested in financial speculation, and the arms that once did this work, along with 
the arms of former policemen, soldiers, bureaucrats, and office workers, lighten 
the load that previously weighed solely upon the manual laborers.There are no 
longer parasites of any type, because all of the inhabitants are simultaneously 
workers and bosses, simultaneously producers and owners. Why would a govern¬ 
ment be necessary? Why would one have to destroy someone else when every¬ 
one feels himseif to be an owner? Here, no one can rise above the others. Each 
produces according to his strength or intelligence, and each consumes to fill his 
needs. Why would one have to hoard? It would be idiotic to do so. 
</p>

<p>
Pedro feds blessed, smiling in his sleep. Butterflies flutter around him, as 
if they were part of his dream. 
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, Pedro feels a sharp pain in his head, and he awakens with a 
shock. It is a policeman, a representative of Her Majesty Authority, which timid 
people believe they could not live without.The officer just kicked the robust and 
spirited day laborer in the head to wake him up, brusquely ordering him to go 
sleep in his house or else he’ll haul him off to jail for vagrancy. Vagrancy! When 
only yesterday the boss told Pedro that he would have no work for the next two 
days. 
</p>

<p>
Pedro trembles with indignation; he turns his back to the officer, and 
marches away. He approaches his house, kisses his children, emotionally says

goodbye to his beloved partner, and proceeds towards the battlefield where the 
valiant are fighting to the cry,“Long Live Land and Liberty!” 
</p>


<p>
BAH! A DRUNK! 
</p>

<p>
Regeneration, April 29, 1911 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by M.V) 
</p>


<p>
That joyous morning was perhaps the saddest for the poor consump¬ 
tive. The sun shone intensely, enriching the beautiful city of Los Angeles with its 
golden radiance. 
</p>

<p>
A few weeks ago, Santiago had been fired from work. The disease had 
infected his bronchial passages and the “good” bourgeois who exploited him for 
many long years decided it was best to throw him out on the streets as soon as 
he understood that the weakened arms of his slave could no longer give him the 
rich profits of the previous year. 
</p>

<p>
When he was a young boy, Santiago worked earnestly. The poor boy 
dreamed, as many other poor people dream, that he would some day earn a 
“good” wage that would allow him to save some pennies with which to pass the 
final days of his life. 
</p>

<p>
Santiago saved. He tightened his belt, and, in this manner, successfully ac¬ 
cumulated some money; but each coin he saved signified a privation, so that, if he 
were ever able to stuff his money box with coins, the arteries of his body would 
find themselves passing less and less blood. 
</p>

<p>
“I will not save anymore,” Santiago said valorously one day when he un¬ 
derstood that his health was declining. In fact, he did not save anymore, and, in 
this way, he could prolong his agony. His wages went up; there is no doubt of 
that. The strikes conducted by his union had resulted in an increase in wages. 
However—there was always a “however”—even though the wages were better 
than before, the cost of primary necessities had reached a level which turned the 
gains of the strike into an illusion, an illusion which had required the sacrifices 
of hunger, homes without heat, beatings from police, and even jail and death in 
clashes with the miserable strikebreakers. 
</p>


<p>
CHAPTER THIRTEEN: STORIES ★ 311 
</p>




<p>
Years passed and his salary rose, and the cost of primary necessities rose 
and rose, while poor Santiago’s family increased in size. The number of working 
hours had been reduced to eight, thanks again to the strikes. However—again the 
“however”—the job that he had to perform in eight hours was the same, exactly 
the same, which he performed before in ten or twelve hours, so that he had to 
mobilize all his abilities, all his force, all the experience acquired in his working 
life in order to come out intact. The cold “lunch” gulped down quickly in a few 
midday minutes; the nervous tension which his body suffered so that he would 
not miss a movement of the machine; the filthiness and poor ventilation of the 
factory; the maddening racket of the machinery; the poor nourishment he could 
obtain, given the high cost of food; the poor residence where his large family 
slept, without any light, without comfortable shelter; the worry that crushed his 
spirit whenever he considered his family’s future; everything, everything con¬ 
spired against his health. He wanted to save some more, thinking that he must 
leave something to his family when he died. But what could he save? He limited 
his family’s expenses to the bone, observing more and more that his poor chil¬ 
dren were losing the healthy rose color from their cheeks and that he himself was 
feeling weak. 
</p>

<p>
Santiago, because he was made of flesh and blood rather than iron, 
didn’t know what to do. He found himself on the horns of a dilemma: whether 
he should scrimp on the cost of his family’s health in order to leave them some 
money when he died, money that should be invested in medicine to combat 
his offspring’s anemia, or whether he should not save anything so that he could 
feed his family better, leaving them penniless when he passed away. And then 
he thought about his family’s helplessness, about the possible prostitution of his 
daughter, about the probable “crimes” that his beloved sons would have to com¬ 
mit to obtain a loaf of bread, about the bitter sorrow of his noble partner. 
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, tuberculosis had progressed throughout his shaking body. 
His friends fled from him, afraid of contracting the illness. The bourgeois still re¬ 
tained him in the factory because he could still work: the boss could still extract 
good sums of money from his unfortunate slave. 
</p>

<p>
The moment came, however, when Santiago was no longer useful to ei¬ 
ther God or the devil, and this bourgeois, who had slapped him on the back 
when, exhausted with fatigue, he had left the factory late at night, after having 
made his boss richer and his own health poorer, this bourgeois now expelled him 
from the factory because there was no longer any reason to have him there: he 
produced very little. 
</p>

</p>




<p>
Santiago arrived at his house with tears in his eyes one afternoon when 
the natural world and everything else seemed to be laughing. The children were 
playing in the streets; the little birds were pecking here and there on the pave¬ 
ment; the dogs, with their intelligent and sympathetic eyes, contemplated the 
march of passers-by, incapable of understanding the pain or joy that dwelled in 
each human heart. The horses swatted their tails at the stubborn flies assaulting 
their lustrous flanks; the young boys selling newspapers brightened the scene 
with their cries and their mischief; the sun prepared to recline on its purple bed. 
So much beauty outside! So much sadness in Santiago’s home!

tiago communicated the sad news to his loyal partner: “Tomorrow, we will no 
longer have bread&#x2026;” 
</p>

<p>
Oh, kingdom of social equality, how much longer will you delay your ar¬ 
rival? 
</p>

<p>
Everything that could be pawned would be given to the pawnshop—they 
are called pawnshops, these dens of thieves protected by the law. To the pawn¬ 
shop they would give, one by one, the modest jewelry which they had possessed, 
transmitted from parents to children in this humble class; to the pawnshop they 
would give the shawl which had illuminated the visage of Santiago’s mother-in- 
law during her youth and which they guarded like a beloved relic; to the pawn¬ 
shop they would give their exquisite painting, the only luxury in their shabby 
living room, which was simultaneously the kitchen, the dining room, the room for 
receiving visitors, and &#x2026; the bedroom; to the pawnshop, they would send even 
their most humble clothing. 
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, the sickness didn’t waste time: it worked and worked with¬ 
out rest, burrowing into Santiago’s lungs. Masses of black spittle shot from the sick 
man’s mouth with each coughing fit.The poor nourishment, the sadness, and the 
lack of medical assistance had pushed the sick man to the brink of the grave, as is 
commonly said. His only recourse would be to enter the prison of the loathsome 
official charities, to which the bourgeoisie condemned the human beings who 
had spent their lives producing so many beautiful things, so many rich things, so 
many fine things, for the pittance they could earn from their miserable salary. 
</p>

<p>
To the hospital, the unfortunate Santiago, all skin and bones, would go, 
while his noble partner went from workshop to workshop, from factory to fac¬ 
tory, pleading for a tormentor to exploit her arms. How long, disinherited broth¬ 
ers, will it take you to decide to smash the iniquity of the current capitalist system 
with your rebellion? 
</p>


<p>

<p>
He remained in the hospital a few days &#x2026; the doctors said it was hope¬ 
less, his condition had no remedy, and he was confined to the ward for the ter¬ 
minally ill. No medicine, poor food, no attention: this was what charity did for 
our sick man, while the bourgeois who exploited him his entire life squandered, 
on enormous feasts, the money gained at the expense of this miserable man’s 
health. 
</p>

<p>
Santiago asked to leave the hospital. He doubted whether there was any 
point in remaining in that prison. On that pretty morning that was, perhaps, the 
saddest morning for the poor consumptive, a policeman arrested him for “va¬ 
grancy” in a public park, thus transporting him from one prison to another. 
</p>

<p>
The beautiful California sun shone intensely.The handsome avenue blos¬ 
somed with well-dressed, cheerful people, little dogs, happier than millions of hu¬ 
man beings, rested in the arms of pretty, elegant bourgeois women, who strolled 
around shopping, while Santiago, in the police car, occasionally heard this excla¬ 
mation: “Bah! A drunk!”

THE BEGGAR AND THE THIEF 
</p>

<p>
Regeneration, December 11, 1915 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by C.B.) 
</p>

<p>
Pedestrians—men and women, perfumed, elegant, arrogant—come and 
go along the pleasant avenue.The beggar sticks to the wall, his insistent hand in 
front of him, a servile supplication trembling on his lips. 
</p>

<p>
“Alms for the poor, for the love of God!” 
</p>

<p>
Occasionally a coin falls into the beggar’s hand, and he hurriedly stuffs it 
into his pocket, while lavishing degrading praise and thanks. The thief passes by, 
and he scowls contemptuously at the beggar.The panhandler becomes indignant, 
because even the undignified can take offense, and he growls with irritation: 
</p>

<p>
“Why don’t you blush with embarrassment, scoundrel, upon looking 
upon an honorable man like me? I respect the law; I don’t commit the crime of 
putting my hand in someone else’s pocket. My footsteps are firm, like those of 
all good citizens who don’t go slinking around at night around other peoples’ 
houses. I can show my face everywhere; I don’t have to evade the policeman’s

<p>
gaze; the rich see me with benevolence and, when they throw a coin in my hat, 
they slap me on the back saying,‘good man!’” 
</p>

<p>
The thief pulled the brim of his hat down to his nose, in a gesture of dis¬ 
gust, and gave a scrutinizing glance in his own turn. He replied to the beggar: 
</p>

<p>
“Don’t expect me to blush before you, vile beggar! You, honorable?! Hon¬ 
or does not live upon its knees waiting for someone to throw it a bone to gnaw 
on. Honor is pride par excellence. I don’t know if I’m honorable or not; but I 
know that I don’t have the courage to ask the rich to give me a crumb, for the 
love of God, from what they’ve taken from me. Do I violate the law? Certainly. But

<p>
this violation is itself an act of justice, because the law authorizes the robbery of 
the poor by the rich, that is, it authorizes an injustice; and when I snatch from 
the rich part of what they’ve stolen from the poor, I commit an act of justice.The 
rich pat you on the back because of your servility, your abject lowliness, that you 
guarantee their peaceful enjoyment of what they’ve stolen from you, me, and all 
the poor people of the entire world.The ideal state for the rich is that all of the 
poor have the soul of a beggar. If you were a man, you’d bite the hand of the rich 
man who throws you a crumb. I despise you!” 
</p>

<p>
The thief spat and lost himself in the crowd.The beggar raised his eyes to 
the heavens and whined:

“Alms for the poor, for the love of God!”

HARVESTING 
</p>

<p>
Regeneracion, December 23, 1911 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by M.V) 
</p>

<p>
On the side of the road, I met a man with tearful eyes and black unruly 
hair contemplating some thistles lying at his feet. “Why are you crying?” I asked 
him, and he responded, “I am crying because I did all the possible good for my 
fellow man, I worked my plot of land as well as I could, as all self-respecting men 
should do; but those to whom I did good made me suffer. My plots of land, lacking 
the water the rich people had taken from me, only produced these thistles you 
see at my feet.” 
</p>


<p>
CHAPTER THIRTEEN: STORIES ★ 315 
</p>




<p>
“It’s a bad harvest,” I tell myself,“that good people reap,” and I resumed 
my march. 
</p>

<p>
A bit further down, I stumbled upon an old man, who kept falling down 
and then getting back up, with bent back and sadness in his wandering gaze. 
“Why are you sad,” I asked him, and he said:“I am sad because I have labored since 
I was seven years old. I was always a hard worker; however, this morning, the boss 
told me, You are much too old, Juan; there’s no longer any work you can do, and 
he slammed the door in my face.”’ 
</p>

<p>
“Such is the harvest of years and years of honorable labor! ” I told myself, 
and I continued walking. 
</p>

<p>
A much younger man, who was missing a leg, came out to meet me, hat 
in hand, begging for “alms for the poor, for the love of god.” Following this, he ut¬ 
tered something that sounded like a howl. “Why are you howling?” I asked him, 
and he told me,“Madero told us that we were going to be free and happy, provid¬ 
ed that we helped elevate him to the presidency of the republic. All my brothers, 
and my father as well, died in the war; I lost my leg and my health, forcing all our 
families to beg for bread.” 
</p>

<p>
“This is the harvest of those who fight to elevate tyrants and to sustain 
the capitalist system,” I told myself, and continued onwards. 
</p>

<p>
Walking a bit more, I met a group of men, walking sluggishly, with sullen 
gazes, shoulders slumped, with dejection, anguish, and even rage in their faces. 
“What motivates your disgust?” I asked them. “We are leaving the factory,” they 
said, “after working twelve hours, with barely enough for a miserable supper of 
beans.” 
</p>

<p>
“Their bosses are the ones who harvest the wealth, not them,” I told my¬ 
self, and I continued along my path. 
</p>

<p>
Finally, it was nighttime. The crickets sang their love songs in the cracks 
of the earth. My ear, attentive, perceived the murmur of a party in the distance. 
I went toward the place where the sound originated, and I found myself before 
a sumptuous palace. “Who lives here,” I asked a servant. “It is the owner of the 
lands you see all around you, as well as the owner of the water that irrigates the 
lands.” 
</p>

<p>
I understood that I was at the foot of the residence of the bandit who 
made that poor man’s field produce only thistles, and, shaking my fist at the hand¬ 
some structure, I thought, “Your next harvest, bourgeois thief, you will have to 
reap with your own hands, because, know this: the slaves are awakening&#x2026;” 
</p>


<p>

</p>




<p>
And I continued my march thinking, thinking, dreaming, dreaming. I 
thought of the heroic resolution of the disinherited people who have the courage 
to take revenge and reappropriate the lands that, according to the law, belong to 
the rich, yet, according to justice and reason, belong to all human beings. I dreamt 
of the happiness of the humble homes after the expropriation; the men and the 
women feeling truly human; the children playing, laughing, enjoying life, their 
stomachs filled with plenty of healthy food.

<p>
WORK, BRAIN, WORK 
</p>

<p>
Regeneration, number 23, February 4, 1911 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by M.V) 
</p>

<p>
“Work, brain, work: shed all the light that you can, and even if you are feel¬ 
ing tired, work, work.The revolution is a maelstrom: it is nourished by brains and 
brave hearts. Evil people do not go to revolution, only good ones; idiots don’t go, 
only thinkers. 
</p>

<p>
“Work, brain, work: shed light. Work until fatigue annihilates you. After¬ 
wards, other brains will come, and after this, more and more. The revolution is 
nourished by brains and noble hearts.” 
</p>

<p>
This is what the revolutionary was thinking one day when the intensity 
of his intellectual work had undone his nerves. From his tiny room he could see 
people walking in different directions: men and women who seemed occupied, 
anxious, as if dominated by an idea. Everyone bustled about in pursuit of bread. In 
some faces, the disappointment was evident; without a doubt, these people had 
gone out to look for work and were returning to their houses empty handed. 
</p>

<p>
Night was approaching, and people circulated in the sad glow of twilight. 
The workers returned to their houses with drooping arms, black with sweat and 
dirt.The plump, complacent bourgeoisie, casting scornful looks at the noble com¬ 
moners who sacrifice themselves for them and their mistresses, headed towards 
the grand theaters or the luxurious palaces that those very same slaves had con¬ 
structed, but where they were not permitted to enter. 
</p>

<p>
The revolutionary’s heart was weighed down by sadness. All these dis¬ 
possessed people were sacrificing themselves pointlessly in the workshops, in the 
</p>


<p>
CHAPTER THIRTEEN: STORIES ★ 317 
</p>




<p>
factories, in the mines, giving up their health, their futures, and the futures of their 
poor families to profit the arrogant bosses, who, whenever they passed close to 
a worker, avoided contacting him in order to protect their fine clothing from 
the his grease and grime. Yes. These poor people sacrificed themselves working 
like mules in order to make their exploiters more powerful, because this is how 
things are arranged: the more the worker sacrifices himself, the richer his bosses 
become and the stronger the worker s chains become. 
</p>

<p>
The revolutionary continued thinking of the dispossessed crowd and 
also of the complacent: the former were care worn, the bourgeoisie had faces ra¬ 
diant with joy. With this disinherited stream of people he had to sweep away the 
dominators; but these people were a tranquil, tame river, very tame, far too tame. 
It would be another thing if they understood their force and their rights. 
</p>

<p>
The revolutionary thought and thought: he was the only rebel in that 
flock; he was the only one who had discovered the way they must resolve the 
grave problem of the proletariat’s economic emancipation. And it was essential 
that the herd know it. “The way is revolution, but not political revolt, whose su¬ 
perficial work comes down solely to substituting the personnel of one govern¬ 
ment with that of another which will follow in the steps of the previous one.The 
way is revolution; but a revolution that finally guarantees sustenance to all human 
beings. What use could a revolution be that did not guarantee sustenance to all? 
</p>

<p>
This is what the revolutionary was thinking while the monotonous pro¬ 
cession of the unconscious continued in the street—those who still believe that 
it is natural and just that their bosses profit from their labor.This is what the revo¬ 
lutionary was thinking, witnessing the comings and goings of the herd—those 
who did not know how to leave on this Earth any other sign of their passage than 
their skeletons in the common grave, misery for their families, and abundance 
and luxury for their political and economic overlords. 
</p>

<p>
“Work, brain, work: shed light. Work until you are annihilated with fa¬ 
tigue. Within the skulls of the multitudes, there are many shadows: illuminate this 
darkness with the blaze of your rebellion!”

<p>
One day Juanito and Luisita, the children of Rosa, could not leave their 
beds: fever was devouring them. Rosa wrung her arms in desperation before the 
pain of her own flesh and blood. It had been three weeks since she had been laid 
off from the factory: there 100 mamr workers in the labor market. In vain she 
scratched to the bottom of the drawers, but she pulled out only playthings and 
utensils: not a penny in the first ones, nothing of value in the last. And there was 
not a piece of bread nor a cup of coffee on the table, and the children, reddened 
by the fever, shook their tiny arms out from under their sheets asking for food.The 
door opened suddenly, and some individuals dressed in black, with paper ledgers 
beneath their arms, penetrated the dwelling without ceremony of any sort. It was 
a notary and his clerks and some assistants who were going to fulfill the mandates 
of the Law. Rosa had not paid her landlord rent for the slum because she had no 
money, and the representatives of Authority had come to throw her in the middle 
of the street&#x2026;. How would Rosa respond, if she were asked if Authority is good for 
the poor?

Amidst the comings and goings and the confusion of the business district, 
a rich man suddenly waves his arms: “Thief! Thief!” From the buttonhole of his 
vest dangles a chain without a watch. The crowd whirls around him; the repre¬ 
sentatives of Authority, clubs in the hand, open a passage among the throng; but 
where is the thief? Everyone who is surrounding the rich man is dressed elegantly. 
Pedro, after searching uselessly for work the entire morning, happens to pass by 
the crime scene. He approaches the multitude trying to inquire about the reason 
for such excitement, and he was pursuing this diligently when he feels a vigorous 
hand grab him by the collar and an arrogant voice shout at him “Come with me, 
</p>

<p>
thief!” It is a policeman. Could Pedro say that Authority is good for the poor?

Jose is feeling tired. He has been running around the city all day in search 
of work. Exhausted, he sits down on a park bench. As soon as he relaxes, he falls 
asleep. A violent jolt wakes him: It is a representative of Authority, who is repri¬ 
manding him for the “crime” of falling asleep. Jose presents his excuses the best 
he can, but the police officer orders him to leave the park. Jose walks and walks

<p>
until, exhausted, he sits down on the edge of a bench on a by-road, falls asleep 
yet again, and is jolted for the second time, a welcome from a representative of 
Authority, who orders him to get on his feet and beat it. Jose explains his situation 
to the policeman: it has been three months since he has worked because there is 
an abundance of slaves, and it has been necessary for him to walk from place to 
place in search of a rich man who will exploit him. The representative of Author¬ 
ity tells him that only bums do not find work: the policeman handcuffs him and 
brings him to jail, where he is put to work for the benefit of Authority. Meanwhile, 
the old parents of Jose, and his family, languish in hunger in the village he left.

Life on the plantation is unbearable for Lucas and his family. The master 
wants to steal his partner’s affection from him; the master’s son wants to rape 
Lucas’s daughter; the majordomos are quite insolent; the wages that he earns are 
starvation wages. Lucas decides to depart with his family; however, they must 
keep it a secret from the master, who, as is known, is the lord of lives and lands. 
The escape is carried out; but so that the talons of Authority will fall upon the 
runaways, the master notifies it of the flight of his slaves.The women are returned

The streets have decomposed from the torrential rains. The bourgeoisie 
need the streets to be replaced as quickly as possible so that their carriages and 
their automobiles can take their short cuts with ease. Authority, then, puts its 
hands upon all of the territory’s working class males and makes them work on 
the reparation of bridges, on the construction of ditches, on the erection of dams, 
without paying them at all, so that the bourgeoisie can continue doing business,

For what do we poor people need Authority? It casts us into the garrison 
and drafts us as soldiers so that we defend, rifle in hand, the interests of the rich, 
as is happening right now in Cananea, where the soldiers are protecting company 
property so that the strikers do not reduce it to rubble; they make us pay taxes 
to sustain presidents, governors, deputies, senators, all manner of policemen, all 
manner of little civil “servants,” judges, magistrates, soldiers, jailers, hangmen, dip¬ 
lomatic representatives, and the whole flock of idlers who only serve to oppress 
us for the benefit of the capitalist class.The poor do not need anything from this 
bunch of leeches, and we must lighten our shoulders of the burden of the capital¬ 
ist system and send it crashing to earth.We must take possession of the land, of 
the houses, of the machinery, of the means of transport, and of the provisions and 
other warehoused articles, and declare that all of this belongs to everyone, men 
and women, in the manner expounded in the Manifesto of September 23,1911.

<p>
THE TWO TRAVELERS 
</p>

<p>
Regeneracion, December 25, 1915 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by M.V.) 
</p>

<p>
Two travelers stopped to rest at the same point on the road, dripping 
with sweat, burdened by the weight of their bundles. 
</p>

<p>
“What are you carrying?” one asked the other. 
</p>

<p>
“Hopes,” he replied.“And you, what are you carrying?” 
</p>

<p>
“ Disappointments.” 
</p>

<p>
And the two travelers regarded each other steadily, the hopeful one smil¬ 
ing, the disappointed one sighing. 
</p>

<p>
The disappointed one said, “Once, I also carried hopes, but one by one 
they succumbed, like flowers transplanted during a frost, and now I carry corpses. 
What is a disappointment but the carcass of a hope?” 
</p>


<p>
CHAPTER THIRTEEN: STORIES ★ 321 
</p>




<p>
The disappointed one sighed, and his eyes, embellished by sorrow, let loose liq¬ 
uid pearls, the sublime condensation of human bitterness. After a brief pause, he 
continued: 
</p>

<p>
“With my pack chock full of hopes, I cast myself into the world search¬ 
ing for a strong man who would rescue the people from misery and tyranny. The 
redeemers abounded like cobblestones, each one possessing a plan about how 
to wipe out all the evils that afflict humanity, each one of them urging his fellow 
citizens to vote for him so he could make the people happy. The people elected 
one or the other of these redeemers, and I did the same as them. Everything was 
in vain. When this or that redeemer reached a position of power, he became a 
tyrant. Man is a liberator when he is down low, an oppressor when he is up high. 
Down with the rest of humanity, a hero considers himself an equal to others and 
feels himself a brother to those who suffer; on the heights, he believes himself to 
be greater than the rest. If you want to corrupt a good man, the only thing you 
have to do is to transform him into a leader.” 
</p>

<p>
The disappointed one lowered his head, like those who are sunk in pro¬ 
found meditation, and continued in this manner: 
</p>

<p>
“This is how, one by one, my hopes died. Humanity is condemned to 
everlasting shackles, because it cannot find a man who can save it.” 
</p>

<p>
And he sighed. This sigh summed up all the disillusionment, all the dis¬ 
couragement, all the dismay of the defeated in the world. 
</p>

<p>
The hopeful one opened his mouth, and with an expression that injected 
confidence and dissipated the pessimism infused by the other, said: 
</p>

<p>
“The people well deserve such failure for running around in search of a 
man who would free them from misery and tyranny. I am not going to look for a 
man to redeem me, but for men to redeem themselves. I do not believe in a man 
who grants freedom, but in men who take it for themselves.‘The emancipation of 
the working class should be the task of the workers themselves.’” 
</p>

<p>
The hopeful one straightened his head and cast a broad glance, which 
appeared to encompass all things, all men, and all the events of history, a glance 
which perceived everything, which could contain everything, and which could 
comprehend all the wisdom united in science. After a short silence, he said: 
</p>

<p>
“The error of humanity has consisted in wanting to be freed from misery 
and tyranny, allowing the cause of the wickedness to remain standing, which is 
the right of private property, and its natural consequences: Government and Re¬ 
ligion. Because individual property needs a dog to guard it: the Government. And 
because it needs a deceiver who maintains the poor in the fear of God so they

do not rebel: the priest. I am going up against Capital,Authority, and Religion. I am 
going to wards Anarchy. I will triumph!”

The two travelers turned their backs to each other, one strong with his 
hopes, the other weak in his disappointments.

<p>
THE TRIUMPH OF THE SOCIAL REVOLUTION 
</p>

<p>
Regeneration, October 23, 1915 
</p>

<p>
(Translated by M.V.) 
</p>

<p>
Juan is ecstatic. He has just seen a notice from Washington in a news¬ 
paper saying that the U.S. has recognized Carranza as the head of the Mexican 
Republic. He effusively embraces his wife Josefa, he kisses his young son, and he 
yells out:“Now, peace will be a reality! Misery will End! Long Live Carranza!” 
</p>

<p>
Josefa stands there with her mouth open, looking at her husband. She 
does not understand how merely elevating a new president to power can put an 
end to misery. She casts a glance around the room, a room in a dead-end alleyway 
in the Mexico City neighborhood of Tepozan, and sighs. Everything around her 
is miserable.The wicker chairs are breaking apart at the bottom.The plate of the 
brazier does not have a sliver of coal.The miserable bed flaunts sheets that display 
arbitrary markings, the product of a physically suffocated child. Atop the rickety 
table glows a stump of paraffin in the neck of a bottle streaked with dense drop¬ 
lets of melted wax. Without realizing that his wife has not understood him, Juan 
yells: “An era of prosperity and liberty has opened before the Mexican people! 
Long live Carranza! ” 
</p>

<p>
Josefa opens her eyes insolently. Decidedly, she does not comprehend 
what relation there could be between the elevation of an individual to power 
and the death of misery. She submerges herself in profound reflections, until a 
louse, perhaps the hungriest among the innumerable ones that populate her 
head, jabs her terribly and returns her to reality. She scratches furiously, eagerly, 
frenetically. At the same time, with a voice enfeebled from prolonged periods of 
fasting, she says to her husband: “Could you tell me Juan, what are the poor going 
to gain when Carranza ascends to the presidency?” 
</p>

<p>
“Come on Josefa, do you still not understand these things? We are going 
to gain laws that benefit the worker.The ones we have favor the agricultural work- 
</p>


<p>
CHAPTER THIRTEEN: STORIES ★ 323 
</p>




<p>
ers.We are going to receive lands from the hands of the government. Finally, we 
are going to enjoy liberty and well-being.” 
</p>

<p>
The outline of a grin forms on Josepha’s lips, expressing the bitterness in 
her heart. Although poor, she has had the opportunity to read something about 
the history of Mexico. She remembers that all the presidents, before reaching a 
high public position, swore, thousands and thousands of times, to dedicate all 
their concerns to the well-being of the people. This was declared in the procla¬ 
mations of Iturbide, the manifestos of Bustamente, the edicts of Santa Anna, and 
the proclamations, manifestos, songs, and circulars of Zuloaga and Comonfort, 
of Gonzalez and of Diaz, in a word, of everyone, including Madero. All vowed to 
make the people happy, and the people suffered under all of them. 
</p>

<p>
A bedbug walks slowly along the wall, as if killing time by going out for 
a stroll, as the poor people, the victims of the capitalist system, decide to go to 
bed.Josefa sees it, and with a prowess that demonstrates a great deal of practice, 
smears it with the tip of her toe, leaving a bright red footprint on the wall. The 
miserable woman casts an almost sympathetic glance at her husband, a glance 
that appears to say:“Poor slave! When will you open your eyes?” 
</p>

<p>
Juan is radiant with joy, and, shaking the newspaper overhead, exclaims: 
</p>

<p>
“This a constitutional order. Respect for individuals; a guarantee of the 
prerogatives of citizenship, without bonds; impartial administrative justice; free 
suffrage; no reelection; honor among public functionaries.What more could you 
want, my wife? Why do you make your face look so sorrowful?” 
</p>

<p>
Josefa replies: “This is all a very lovely dream; but what about the bread: 
who will give us bread?” 
</p>

<p>
“Ha, ha, ha! For that, I have arms,” Juan says, laughing. He adds,“Only the 
lazy will die of hunger.” 
</p>

<p>
Discouraged, Josefa lets her arms drop. “Most certainly,” she thinks,“Juan 
is a perfect sheep.” Louse bites make her scratch herself desperately, until she 
begins to spout blood. Suddenly, sound peals: it is the church bells of the parish 
of Santa Ana. Drifting fromTezontlale comes the rumble of cries, the clatter of the 
firecrackers, the peal of all the bells that every church emits mixed with the tri¬ 
umphant notes of a military band playing a two-step.The noise winds up making 
Juan enthusiastic to the point of delirium. It is the supporters of Carranza who are 
celebrating the recognition of Carranza’s government by foreign governments 
and the capitalists they represent. Taking off his hat, Juan marches out into the 
street to give free rein to his exaltation, crying at the top of his lungs: “Long Live 
Carranza! ” 
</p>


<p>

</p>




<p>
A month has passed. Juan works, but his situation has not changed. His 
miserable salary is just barely enough to prevent himself, Josef a, and his young 
son from dying of hunger.The room still has the same broken windows, the same 
miserable bed with its stained sheets, the poor table that they still have not been 
able to replace. In the brazier, they still cannot cook a decent soup: pieces of coal 
cost too much, as if they were made of gold. The many bloody splotches on the 
walls indicate that the bedbugs still have not abandoned their habit of going for a 
walk before eating, ine louses extract me nie from poor Josef a. 
</p>

<p>
“How much have we gained from the elevation of Carranza?! Truly, my 
beloved Juan!” Josefa says with a certain sneer. 
</p>

<p>
Juan scratches his head, tormented by the louses and by the deception. 
He believed that Carranza’s ascendance to power would ensure abundance in the 
home. Nevertheless, he cannot accept defeat. He exclaims: 
</p>

<p>
“It is impossible that a government can make the people happy in just 
one month. Let’s give them some time so they can implement the reforms that 
</p>

<p>
will benefit the masses.Then we will see.”

A year has passed.The conditions of Juan’s life are the same as before. Cer¬ 
tainly, the salaries are now greater. However, the owner of the house has increased 
the rents of the rooms; the merchants have raised the prices of primary necessi¬ 
ties; clothes are more expensive now than they were before. Now, he works no 
more than eight hours a day. However, in the end, he has to do the same, exactly 
</p>

<p>
the same, that he did before in twelve, fourteen, and even sixteen hours.

<p>
Josefa has a copy of Regeneration in her hands. She reads it with marked 
interest, abandoning the reading for moments only when the pokings of the para¬ 
sites make the intervention of her fingernails absolutely indispensable. Juan paces 
back and forth around the room. Visibly agitated, he holds in his hand a red book¬ 
let, whose color is the only joyous tone in this dark well of misery, filth, and sad¬ 
ness. It is the Manifesto of September 23,1911. 
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, Juan interrupts his pacing, and, slapping his forehead, exclaims: 
“What a blockhead I’ve been, and, along with me, all the workers who supported 
Carranza! We live here in misery, in the ultimate misery, even though we break our 
backs in work just like we did before we elevated that old scoundrel to power. 
Those redistributions of land wound up being the crudest deceptions. One has to

bribe officials to get anything. The laws that supposedly protect the worker are 
actually written to protect capital.The bourgeoisie contrived to retrieve every¬ 
thing they had lost to us in a cunning manner. The concessions they made in their 
constitutional orders do not profit poor people. We continue to be, in virtue of 
our miserable poverty, the same pariahs as before. Death to Carranza!” 
</p>

<p>
“Death to all Government!” yells Josef a, shaking the issue of Regener¬ 
ation in her hand like a flag. 
</p>

<p>
“Long live Anarchy!” Juan yells, shaking the red booklet, whose pages 
spout the freshness of youth, the breezes of spring, the balm of hope, and the rays 
of the sun for all who suffer, for all who breathe, for all who drag their existence 
along in the black abyss of slavery and tyranny &#x2026;

For the first time, the sordid room is ennobled, for it serves as the haven 
for a pair of lions and a cub.

Several days passed. The barricades of Mexico City present a formidable 
front.The united neighborhoods of Merced, Curtidos, and Manzanares have erect¬ 
ed barricades in two hours. Men, women, elders, children, and even some disabled 
people have taken part in the work. The ugly edifice of the Merced market has 
provided most of the material. Behind the barricade bristles a sea of palm hats. 
The leather sandals and the crude shoes of the defenders tread the black land 
energetically, now proud to serve as pedestals for a band of heroes. For many 
moments they await the attack of government forces. Everything bustles behind 
the barricades.The women dig trenches; the men clean their rifles; the children 
distribute outfits to those champions of the proletariat. A red flag, with white let¬ 
ters bearing the inscription “Land and Liberty” smiles in the sun at the top of a 
barricade, sending its salute to all the disinherited of the Earth from its peak.The

The proletarians of Rastro and San Antonio Abad are no less active. The 
butchers sharpen their knives, testing them with the tips of their thumbs. The 
streets adjacent to Rastro and the factory of Hilados and Tejidos are stripped of 
paving stones. All the materials have been converted into resources for the con¬ 
struction of the barricade. Tables, pottery, pianos, clothing, mattresses: all have 
been piled up in a horribly confusing heap of objects, serving to shield the noble 
bosoms of its defenders.

<p>
Maria la Redonda, La Lagunilla; all the residents of the various districts of the 
populous city have vacated their dwellings, emboldened by the revolutionary fire. 
They prepare to resist the attack of the military officers supporting Carranza. The 
barricades spring forth from the land in the blink of an eye.The barricades of San 
Lazaro and San Antonio Tomatlan show upon their summit a singular flag. It is an 
old petticoat, torn and grimy. It is the flag of misery! It is the brave rag defying the 
world of oppression and privilege. As long as the tatters are not detached from 
the proletariat’s body, the master remains tranquil. When it appears attached to 
the top of a staff, the world trembles. 
</p>

<p>
Whereas all the barricades are filled with enthusiasm, nothing surmounts 
the activity, enthusiasm, audacity, and revolutionary zeal in the united barricade 
of the neighborhoods of Peralvillo, Santa Anna, and Tezontlale. Juan and Josefa do 
not rest for a moment. Blackened with powder, they look very beautiful, sweat¬ 
ing, panting, crossing to and fro along the barricade, communicating energy and 
enthusiasm to its defenders. Suddenly a formidable clamor, followed by rifle shots 
and bugle blasts can be heard from the direction of Concepcion Tequipehuca. 
</p>

<p>
“It is our comrades from BolsaandTepito fighting!”Juan cries,tossing his 
hat into the air. 
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later the air resounds with the roar of cannons, the racket 
of rifle shots, the beating of the drums, the angry cries of the bugle, the martial 
airs of the military bands. They are all jumbled together in one thunderous crack 
throughout the entire city. All of the barricades are being attacked simultaneously 
by Carranza’s forces. 
</p>

<p>
Juan and Josefa climb to the height of the barricade where they see a 
dense column of Carranza supporters approaching the streets of Santo Domingo 
on foot. 
</p>

<p>
“Finally, the enemy is closing in, comrades,” they yell at the same time. 
“Everybody: choose the place that best suits you to defend our bastion!” 
</p>

<p>
In an instant, the barricade is crowned with rifles.The enemy places two 
cannons at the base of Santa Catarina y Moras street, while part of the column 
continues advancing toward the barricade, which is situated at the base of the 
street. 
</p>

<p>
An imperious voice emerges from the column when it is a hundred paces 
away from the barricade: “In the name of the supreme government, give your¬ 
selves up!” it says. 
</p>


<p>
CHAPTER THIRTEEN: STORIES ★ 327 
</p>




<p>
“Long live Land and Liberty!” the defenders of the barricade answer. 
Rifle shots follow rapidly from both sides. The cannons direct their pro¬ 
jectiles against the center of the barricade in order to open a breach. The smoke 
saturates the atmosphere until it becomes unbreathable.The attack is furious; the 
resistance is formidable. Carranza s officers accompany their shots with abusive 
words; the proletarian defenders of the barricade sing: 
</p>

<p>
“Child of the people, shackles constrict you, 
</p>

<p>
“but this injustice cannot continue: 
</p>

<p>
“If your existence is filled with pain, 
</p>

<p>
“Rather than being a slave, prefer to die.” 
</p>

<p>
Broadcast to the four winds like an invitation to dignity and honor are 
the notes of this magnificent hymn; of this hymn common to all the downtrod¬ 
den of the world; of this hymn that condenses all the bitter martyrdoms of the 
people and the anguish of its saints who long for redemption, of this hymn that is 
simultaneously a complaint, a protest, and a threat.

of the Social Revolution. The capitalist system has died.

</p>

<p>
“Our domination of the masses has ended,” said the ruler and the capital¬ 
ist in a single voice. 
</p>

<p>
The priest smiled and said, in an assured tone: 
</p>

<p>
“Don’t worry yourselves. It’s certain that taith nas tost groun«, dui i can 
assure you that, through the means of religion, we can recuperate everything 
that we’ve lost. At first glance, it appears that the ideas contained in this damned 
booklet have triumphed in the village, and they will certainly triumph if we do 
nothing. I don’t deny that these evil ideas enjoy a certain sympathy among the 
common people; but others repudiate them, above all they repudiate those that 
attack religion, and it is among these that we can foment a reactionary movement. 
Fortunately, we three could escape, because if we’d have perished at the hands of 
the revolutionaries, the old institutions would have died with us. 
</p>

<p>
The capitalist and the ruler felt as if a great weight had been lifted off 
their backs. The eyes of the capitalist flashed, burning with greed. How? How 
could it be possible for him to return to enjoying the possession of his fields, 
cattle, mills, and factories? Had it all been nothing but a cruel nightmare? Could 
he return to having all of the people of the region under his power, thanks to the 
good offices of religion? And, rising to his feet, he shook his fist in the direction of 
the village, whose country houses shined brilliantly white beneath the sun. 
</p>

<p>
The ruler, emotionally, said with conviction: 
</p>

<p>
“I have always believed that religion is the firmest support for authority. 
Religion teaches that God is the primary boss, and that we rulers are his lieuten¬ 
ants on Earth. Religion condemns rebellion because it holds that the rulers are 
above the people by the will of God. Long live religion!” 
</p>

<p>
Fired up by his own words, the ruler snatched from the hands of the capi¬ 
talist the red booklet, tearing it to shreds and throwing the scraps in the direction 
of the village, as a challenge to the noble insurrectionary workers. 
</p>

<p>
“Dogs!” he cried. “Receive this along with my spit!” 
</p>

<p>
“The scraps of paper flew happily away, blown by the wind, like big toy 
butterflies. They were the Partido Liberal Mexicano manifesto of September 23,

<p>
The first shadows of night began to fall in the valley, and in the twilight 
one could see waving, above one small house in the village, a red flag bearing in 
white letters this inscription: “Land and Liberty.”The ruler, the capitalist, and the 
priest screamed, waving their fists at the village: 
</p>

<p>
“Nest of vipers! We ll soon crush you!” 
</p>

<p>
The final rays of the sun still shone in the west as it set; the frogs began 
their customary serenade, free, happy, ignorant of the miseries that men suffer. In 
the ash tree, a pair of songbirds sang their song of free love, free of judges, priests, 
law clerks. The peaceful beauty of the hour invited the human heart to manifest 
all of its tortures, and for those sentiments to materialize in a work of art. 
</p>

<p>
Making even the rocks shake, a formidable cry rolled up the canyon: 
“Who is there?” 
</p>

<p>
The ruler, the capitalist, and the cleric trembled, anticipating their end. 
Night had finally laid all of the rays from the sun to rest; the songbirds grew quiet; 
the frogs fell silent; a gust of wind agitated frighteningly the branches of the ash 
tree; and in the darkness, frightfully, returned the ominous cry: “Who is there?” 
</p>

<p>
The three estimable persons remembered in a single second their crimes: 
they had enjoyed all the good things of life at the cost of the suffering of the hum¬ 
ble; they had maintained humanity in ignorance and misery in order to satisfy 
their appetites. 
</p>

<p>
The sound of energetic footsteps grew louder: they were those of the 
soldiers of the people, of the soldiers of the social revolution. A round of gunfire 
left rolling in the dust, without life, the representatives of the hydra with three 
heads Authority, Capital, Clergy.

hanging from a telegraph pole, lying in the earth, or whose bloated corpse isn’t 
rotting in the sun, because these brave workers understand that, if they allow a 
single one of these parasites to escape, they won’t tarry in returning at the head 
of a cloud of mercenaries to stab them in the back. 
</p>

<p>
“What can we do now?’’And the anxious question is repeated by thou¬ 
sands and thousands of worried lips, because these men, who do not fear the ma¬ 
chine gun and enthusiastically greet the roar of the enemy’s cannon, which could 
send them to their deaths with each shot, feel timid in the presence of life, which 
offers itself to them, splendid, beautiful, good, and sweet.

ends of their shawls; the kids, in their innocence free of the preoccupations of

like, invading orchards, and for the first time in their lives satisfy, to the point of 
stuffing themselves, their appetites.

<p>
The multitude stirs before this spectacle. It is the children who, in their 
innocence, are teaching their elders what should be done. It’s natural for the chil¬ 
dren, whose minds haven’t been corrupted by the preoccupations or prejudices 
which enchain the minds of their elders, to do what is just: to take whatever is 
at hand. The multitude stirs itself, and in its agitation a sea of ragged hats wave. 
The sun, our father, upon kissing the rags of the dignified plebeians, allows to fall, 
generously, upon them part of its light, its gold, its beauty, and those rags are the 
happy banners of victory. 
</p>

<p>
In the midst of this sea surges a man who appears the most virile of this 
ship en march to life. It’s Gumersindo, the austere campesino who ended up be¬ 
ing seen in the most dangerous places with his scythe held high, the harvester 
of the evildoers’ heads, and the symbol, at the same time, of fertile, noble work. 
Gumersindo swings his sarape over his shoulder, and the crowd falls quiet; one 
can hear a pin drop.With emotion, Gumersindo says: 
</p>

<p>
“The children are setting the example. Let us imitate them.The indispens¬ 
able thing is to eat; that should be our first task. Let us take from the shops and 
warehouses what we need to satisfy our hunger. Comrades: let us for the first time 
eat whatever we want!” 
</p>

<p>
In the blink of an eye, the crowd invades the shops and warehouses, with 
everyone taking what they need; in other parts of the city, the same thing occurs, 
and for the first time in the history of this people there isn’t a single human be¬ 
ing who goes hungry. A great joy reigns in the entire city.The houses are empty:

<p>
the entire world is in the streets; ad hoc groups of musicians wander the streets 
playing happy tunes. Everyone greets each other, and all call themselves brothers, 
even though they didn’t know each other a few hours before. There is dancing, 
singing, laughing, crying, jesting in the streets. Frolicking everywhere.The tyran¬ 
nical rules of the police are at an end! 
</p>

<p>
Night comes, but no one thinks of sleeping.The fiesta of liberty contin¬ 
ues, even more joyful, if that were possible. With the municipal services disorga¬ 
nized by the disappearance of the principle of authority, men and women of good 
will tend to the public lighting, haul off the dead bodies from the streets, and they 
do all of this with good cheer, without needing orders from above nor barracks¬ 
like rules. Now the dawn of the new day breaks, and the fiesta, the great fiesta of 
liberty shows no signs of ending. And why should it? The death of centuries of 
oppression merits celebration, not only for a few hours, not only for a day, but 
</p>

<p>
until the body, done in by an excess of pleasure, demands rest.

<p>
While the entire population is delivering itself to pleasures, pleasures of 
which it never could have dreamed, the comrades of the group The Equals, com¬ 
posed of men and women, work day and night. 
</p>

<p>
The noble builders of the new order hardly sleep. Dirty, stubbled, ex¬ 
hausted by their continual vigilance, they still find themselves, nonetheless, active, 
enthusiastic, valiant. Upon their shoulders rests the gigantic task of constructing 
anew upon the rubble of a past filled with slavery and infamy. They make use of 
the old town hall to hold their meetings. Ramon, the railroad worker, speaks with 
enthusiasm. He has barely slept for five days, since the taking of the city by the 
proletarian forces. He is radiant. His bronzed, square face, in which can be seen 
honesty, resolution, audacity, sincerity, shines as if behind his dark skin burns the 
sun. He sweats, his eyes shine intensely, and among other things he says: 
</p>

<p>
“Finally the people enjoy themselves. Finally thousands of years of pain 
have been thrown off. Finally, the people know the pleasures of life. Let us enjoy 
their happiness as a father enjoys seeing his children play. Let our brothers enjoy 
themselves, until it exhausts them. Meanwhile we will work: we will finish the 
plans of social reconstruction.” 
</p>

<p>
The happy notes of a waltz rise from the street, turning all heads toward 
the windows.The waltz ends, and then comes an explosion of shouts, whistles, 
laughter, and noises of all types produced by striking things together. 
</p>

<p>
“The people are enjoying themselves,” says Ramon;“Let us work.” 
</p>

<p>
And the men and women of The Equals continue with their labor. 
</p>


<p>
332 ★ DREAMS OF FREEDOM

<p>
Ten days have passed since the proletarian forces have taken the city, and 
the entire population rests after a week of pleasures celebrating liberty. Numerous 
groups of proletarians meet in the plazas asking themselves what would be good 
to do.The comrades of The Equals have finished their plans for social reconstruc¬ 
tion and have put up flyers on the street corners, in which they invite the inhabit¬ 
ants of the various parts of the city to meet in places determined by those who 
live in the various parts to deal with affairs of common interest. Everyone heeds 
the call, since everyone is anxious to do something. For many the future is uncer¬ 
tain; ror otners die huii<sup>un</sup> is limited, ihcrc ic nc lack cf those that 
</p>

<p>
the wrath of heaven will soon discharge itself upon those judged by the priests; 
fear of the unknown is general; uneasiness commences to murmur &#x2026; 
</p>

<p>
The comrades of The Equals find themselves scattered around differ¬ 
ent parts of the city, and in simple language explain to the people the goodness 
of communist anarchism. The people mill around. They don’t want words; they 
want actions.They have reason: they’ve been defrauded so often. But no: this time 
they’re not dealing with a swindle, and the orators expound with clarity that 
which must be done immediately, without delay, on the march. The first thing 
which must be done is to investigate, with the greatest exactitude possible, the 
number of inhabitants of the city and to make an exact inventory of the articles, 
foodstuffs, and clothing which exists in the stores and warehouses in order to 
calculate how long the population can feed and cloth itself with the stocks on 
hand. 
</p>

<p>
The problem of housing has been resolved in part during the days of 
the fiesta celebrating liberty by the people of the city; on their own initiative 
they have taken up residence in the houses of the capitalists and parasites of all 
descriptions, who have now disappeared forever.There are still many families oc¬ 
cupying shacks and barrios, but upon hearing of this, the masons come forward 
saying that they will build as many comfortable, attractive houses as are necessary. 
They themselves, immediately, without the need of anyone ordering them around, 
name committees to take charge of seeing that the number of houses it’s neces¬ 
sary to construct without delay corresponds to the number of people who still 
live in shacks and barrios.

<p>
The murmuring ceases: that which is being arranged dissipates the fears 
and suspicions. “This is for real,” is said, and in the people’s hearts confidence 
is reborn, with a warming light, dissipating their numbness, something which

<p>
is so necessary to all human effort. More than enough men of good will lend 
themselves to taking the census of the population and to taking the inventory 
of all warehoused articles, because it’s not only necessary to inventory articles 
related to food and clothing, but also those that are of domestic use and of use in 
industry. 
</p>

<p>
The applause grows, not to reward the merits of the volunteers but as an 
indication of the expansion of the people’s spirit, because these simple people 
understand that doing one’s duty is not meritorious, and the sea of humble som¬ 
breros waves happily beneath the rays of the friendly sun. The women appear 
happy, dressed cleanly, in the clothes taken from the stores; the children suspend 
their frolics, afflicted by furious stomach aches due to their stuffing themselves; 
flocks of birds fly happily above the throng, leaving behind a feeling of freshness, 
of health, of youth, of Spring. Every dawn is beautiful, for how could a dawn of 
liberty and justice not be beautiful?

Meetings were suspended yesterday until two o’clock today.The volun¬ 
tary committee members are all present: they have all brought with them the 
exact number of inhabitants of the city, as well as the inventory of the foodstuffs 
and other goods in the stores and warehouses. 
</p>

<p>
The day is splendid, a day at the end of April in which there is light, per¬ 
fume, color, youth, love.Women work voluntarily in the gardens, the flowers show 
off their silky petals, and the soft, warm, damp shoots of vegetables respond to the 
care and love. 
</p>

<p>
There is animated talk in the same places that yesterday were the sites 
of meetings.“What good, and so quickly!, has been done when there is no inter¬ 
vention of authority,’’ is said in conversations. Hearts beat excitedly. Gumersindo 
has no time to rest: extremely active, he goes to all the sections of the city in an 
expropriated automobile, now the property of the community, and his agitation 
is extremely necessary, because it lends unity to the resolutions made in each 
part of the city. He hasn’t abandoned his scythe, which tied to the hood of the car 
lends prestige and luster to that formerly aristocratic machine.The sarape on the 
</p>

shoulder of the campesino is the guarantee of his lack of self-interest.

Now it is known how many inhabitants there are in the city and what 
there is in the way of manufactured goods. Despite not having a mathematician at 
hand, the time in which the existing goods will last is quickly calculated—some¬ 
thing necessary to arranging production. Hundreds of workers’ hands write out 
numbers with expropriated pencils. 
</p>


<p>
334 ★ DREAMS OF FREEDOM 
</p>




<p>
In a few minutes these men of the hammer, the shovel, the wood chisel, 
and the steel chisel say that, having so many inhabitants, this much in the way of 
foodstuffs will be needed daily, and that, having found such a quantity of food¬ 
stuffs, the entire people can subsist for so much time. 
</p>

<p>
Everyone is satisfied with this. “Damn, but this is going well!” they say. 
Now one doesn’t hear a single murmur. “Truly, in arranging things there’s no one 
better than the anarchists,” they add, and the cheering for anarchy thunders out in 
the ovations that the sacred ideal justly receives. Ramon, the railroad worker, cry¬ 
ing with emotion and waving on high a small red book, says with a voice racked 
by sobs:“This is our reacnerr it s the manifc»i.u of 23,1?11, iccucd by

Ramon is splendid. His square face, which appears to have been chiseled 
from hard wood, is radiant, like that of all heroes.The hero is not a god, since an¬ 
archists don’t have gods, but rather a being who by his acts raises himself above 
the rest of us as an example, as a great, healthy, teaching, and, like it or not, shines 
as a sun. 
</p>

<p>
Ramon explains the necessity that exists, given the data at hand, that all 
the workers in the same industry unite in order to come to accord about how 
to organize the work in their industry, and that once this accord is reached, that 
delegates from the workers of all of the industries come to agreement in order to 
produce what the people need. Everyone approves the idea, and this agreement 
is conveyed by Gumersindo to the assemblies in the different parts of the city, 
who receive it with a great show of enthusiasm. An era of progress and prosper^ 
ity opens in the redeemed city, in which production quickly adjusts itself to the 
</p>

<p>
necessities of the people, and not to the enrichment of a few bandits.

Volunteers in various trades have finished constructing great public ware¬

were to fail! But they work with a great faith in success, with an intense faith 
born of profound conviction. However, some details preoccupy them. The city 
can’t exist without work in the fields. It’s necessary that the campesino give to 
the worker what he needs to eat, as well as the raw materials for industry: cotton, 
agave fiber, wool, wood, and many other things. In exchange, the campesino will 
have the right to take from the warehouses of the city whatever he needs: cloth¬ 
ing, foodstuffs, natural or manufactured, furniture, machinery, and work tools—in 
a word, everything he needs.The metallurgic industries worker needs the miner 
to supply him with metals, obtaining in exchange, like his brother the campesino, 
everything that he needs. 
</p>

<p>
“Yes!” cries Ramon enthusiastically, “We need the cooperation of the 
campesino, the miner, the quarry worker, of all who work outside the city, and 
we’ll get it!” 
</p>

<p>
A cloud of authorized volunteers spreads itself throughout the region 
conquered through the arms of the workers, in order to invite their brothers to 
cooperate in the great work of social production. Everyone accepts this with en¬ 
thusiasm and promises to send to the city that which they produce, in exchange 
for that which the city produces.

Anarchist society is now a fact. Everyone works, everyone produces ac¬ 
cording to his aptitudes and abilities, and consumes according to his needs. The 
elderly and invalids do not work. Everyone lives happily, because they feel free. 
No one commands and no one obeys. Harmony reigns in the workplaces, without 
foremen, without bosses.The traffic on the streetcars, railways, highways, of carts 
and cars, is great, because everyone now has the right to transportation to wher¬

Less than a month has been enough to obtain this happy result. Finally 
humanity has regenerated itself through the adoption of the principles of com¬ 
munist anarchism. One needn’t comment on the emotional state in which Gum- 
ersindo and Ramon find themselves upon contemplating the beautiful work to 
which they’ve contributed so much. After walking up a nearby hill they see with 
eyes damp from emotion the peaceful, tranquil, brotherly city.The whisper of the 
vast metropolis reaches them even there. Now it is isn’t the whisper of fatigue 
nor the death rattle of agony of a population of slaves, but rather the wide, deep, 
healthy whisper of a city of free and happy human beings.

In Regeneration, Ricardo sums up the aim of the PLM “The Liberal Party 
works for the welfare of the poor classes of the Mexican people. It does not 
impose a candidate lin the presidential elections], because it will be up to 
the will of the people to settle the question. Do the people want a master? 
Well, let them elect one. All the PLM desires is to accomplish a change in the 
mind of the toiling people, so that every man and woman should know that 
no one has the right to exploit anybody; that we all, by the mere fact of com¬ 
ing to this Earth, have the right to all we need as long as we contribute to 
the production of things, and that no one has the right to appropriate tillable 
land, because it is a gift of nature of which we all have the right to reap the 
inherent benefits&#x2026;”

Ricardo writes in Re generation.“ Governments have to protect the right of 
property above all other rights. Do not expect, then, that Madero will attack 
the right of property in favor of the proletariat. Open your eyes. Remember a 
phrase, simple and true and as truth indestructible:‘The emancipation of the 
workers must be the work of the workers themselves.’”

1 DREAMS OF FREEDOM 
</p>







<p>
Along with such legendary figures as Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata, Ricardo Flores Magon was 
one of the primary forces behind the Mexican Revolution. Born in Mexico in 1874, Magon was a 
tireless activist and journalist under the Diaz military regime. Through his widely read newspaper, 
Regeneration, which suffered continuous government suppression, he boldly criticized the injustices 
of the country’s dictatorship and worked to build the popular movement which would eventually 
overthrow it. Exiled to the United States, Flores Magon remained one of the most influential agitators 
for the Mexican Revolution. Both governments responded with harsh repression. Leavenworth 
Penitentiary finally murdered him in 1922. 
</p>


<p>
This historic volume presents Magon’s passionate, revolutionary writings in English for the first time. 
It includes a lengthy biographical sketch that places his work in historical context, a comprehensive 
chronology, bibliography, and an introduction by Benjamin Maldonado. 
</p>


<p>
“Mitchell Verter and Chaz Bufe have given us a great gift with this fascinating volume on Ricardo 
Flores Magon. He was a revolutionary from a very different time from our own, but today’s activists 
will make an immediate and intense connection with his passion for social justice. This is a gift that 
will only grow as you pass it along to others!” 
</p>


<p>
“From the darker nations comes the vibrant and still fresh voice of the tremendous anarcho- 
communist, Ricardo Flores Magon. In Mexico they have streets named after him. Elsewhere, he is 
little known. Hopefully those who are illiterate in Spanish will now take this great radical into our 
hearts through this very powerful collection. Land and Liberty!” 
</p>


<p>
“&#x2026;the significance of this volume cannot be overstated. With Dreams of Freedom, Flores Magon can 
continue to enlighten and inspire ever-wider populations of radicals and anti-authoritarians for 
generations to come.” 
</p>

<p>
“The life, words, and ideas of Ricardo Flores Magon are as important today as they were around 100 
years ago&#x2026; Bravo for this wonderful book that won’t let us forget those days and those heroes. Today 
as always, remembering is revolutionary.”
