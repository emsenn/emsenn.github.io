<blockquote id="org4eb57a9">
<p>
The Web was so small, then. So small that it was conceivable that one could maintain a list of every site.
</p>

<p>
And it really was both new and cool to use a 1-frame-a-minute webcam to spy on a coffee machine on another continent or click a Big Red Button That Does Nothing.
</p>

<p>
Back then, we didn’t have platforms or feeds or social networks or… blogs.
</p>

<p>
We had <i>homepages</i>.
</p>

<p>
The backgrounds were grey. The font, Times New Roman. Links could be any color as long as it was medium blue.[…]
</p>

<p>
Assuming you knew a handful of tags, it took about a minute to create a new web page.
</p>

<p>
There were no databases to configure. No scripts to install. No plugins, no security patches. There were no cookies.[…]
</p>

<p>
We built every new page by hand. When we had more than one web page, we built the navigation by hand. We managed our Table of Contents by hand. We broke out our calculators to code boundaries for our image maps. We talked unironically about “hyperlinks.”[…]
</p>

<p>
No two homepages were alike. There was certainly no such thing as a Content Management System. But it didn’t mean that the homepage content wasn’t managed.[…]
</p>

<p>
Dates didn’t matter all that much. Content lasted longer; there was less of it. Older content remained in view, too, because the dominant metaphor was table of contents rather than diary entry.
</p>

<p>
Everyone with a homepage became a de facto amateur reference librarian.
</p>

<p>
Obviously, it didn’t last.

<h3 id="org38b9da9">Early history of blogs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org38b9da9">
<blockquote id="orgefdac9b">
<p>
In ‘94, a college student named Justin Hall broke free from the table of contents format. He added to the top of his homepage daily, and he headlined each section with the date. He shared everything: from interesting links he found to his experiments with sex and drugs.
</p>

<p>
Justin’s Links became the first daily web diary.
</p>

<p>
That’s what they were called then… web diaries. (The name weblog came a few years later, as some of their writers moved away from extremely personal topics.)
</p>

<p>
Most diaries existed as a separate section linked from the regular personal homepage of the diarist in question. The diary entries were either all inline content, like Justin’s, or individually linked from an index page.
</p>

<p>
But here was the big departure: the entries, either inline or linked, weren’t organized by content or primacy or importance or category.
</p>

<p>
They were always in reverse chronological order.[…]
</p>

<p>
They were, like the web itself, quirky and highly personal, often confessional in style. It was all so very Microserfs.
</p>

<p>
But it wasn’t very popular.
</p>

<p>
When jjg compiled his list of “web logs” in early 1999, there were only 23. That’s not a typo: Twenty-three, twenty-three web logs on the internet, ah ah ah. No doubt he missed many — and a bunch had lived and died by then, including mine — but by what kind of multiplier? Five? Ten times? So there were what, maybe 230 web logs?
</p>

<p>
By late 2000, there were still only 1,285 according to Eatonweb. Same disclosures apply on those numbers, of course, but seriously…
</p>

<p>
The “weblog” world was small.
</p>

<p>
The early web itself, of course, was pretty exclusive: first, you had to be online, then you had to know HTML, and that wasn’t enough, you also had to have a hosting account, and know how to use it. There was no royal road. Each would-be Netizen had to bushwhack their own path.[…]
</p>

<p>
Chronological content was in the minority.[…]
</p>

<p>
It was boring, tedious, and involved.
</p>

<p>
And that didn’t change when Blogger and Livejournal appeared on the scene in 1999 — the same year as jjg’s list of 23. Neither was an immediate success. For pioneers accustomed to the power of free-form HTML, their limited features and lack of control chafed.

<h3 id="orga0f9f07">The devastation of Movable Type</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga0f9f07">
<blockquote id="org0f044bf">
<p>
The first real movement came in 2001. That’s when there debuted an invention that would revolutionize the way people across the globe distributed their written content:
</p>

<p>
Movable Type.[…]
</p>

<p>
MT wasn’t the first tool to facilitate rapid web publishing, but it was the first powerful one that appealed to the tweakers, the do-it-yourselfers, the webmonkeys.[…]
</p>

<p>
It was the first viable alternative to all that manual work. It made updating a weblog easy. Without giving up total control.[…]
</p>

<p>
Movable Type wasn’t a revolution, technically speaking. It wasn’t a live web app like the CMSes of today; it didn’t serve up dynamic content. It wasn’t fancy.[…]
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Culturally, though, it was devastating.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly people weren’t creating homepages or even web pages, but they were writing web content in form fields and text areas inside a web page.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, instead of building their own system, they were working inside one.
</p>

<p>
A system someone else built.[…]
</p>

<p>
Here’s the crux of the problem: When something is easy, people will do more of it.
</p>

<p>
When you produce your whole site by hand, from HEAD to /BODY, you begin in a world of infinite possibility. You can tailor your content exactly how you like it, and organize it in any way you please. Every design decision you make represents roughly equal work because, heck, you’ve gotta do it by hand either way. Whether it’s reverse chronological entries or a tidy table of contents. You might as well do what you want.
</p>

<p>
But once you are given a tool that operates effortlessly — but only in a certain way — every choice that deviates from the standard represents a major cost.
#+end<sub>quote</sub>
</p>

<blockquote id="org78dedab">
<p>
That’s what happened as Movable Type ate the blogosphere.
</p>

<p>
Homepage production became suddenly a question of economics:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Go with the system’s default format: zero work.</li>
<li>Customizing the system to your format: way more work than pure HTML ever was</li>
</ol>

<p>
And who, once offered a path of least resistance, has the energy to fight it all the way?
</p>

<p>
The format won.
</p>

<p>
It was easier — faster! — to literally go with the flow… of time.[…]
</p>

<p>
Thus began the Chronological Sort Era.
</p>

<p>
Or, as I like to call it:
</p>

<p>
CHRONOS RULES EVERYTHING AROUND ME.
</p>

<p>
Movable Type didn’t just kill off blog customization.
</p>

<p>
It (and its competitors) actively killed other forms of web production.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="orgaaea81b">
<p>

</p>

<p>
Non-diarists — those folks with the old school librarian-style homepages — wanted those super-cool sidebar calendars just like the bloggers did. They were lured by the siren of easy use. So despite the fact that they weren’t writing daily diaries, they invested time and effort into migrating to this new platform.
</p>

<p>
They soon learned the chronostream was a decent servant, but a terrible master.[…]
</p>

<p>
But they’d already switched. They’d already spent all that time and energy and optimism. To switch back, they’d have to go through that process all over again. Only worse, of course, because they’d have to build the new (old) site completely from scratch. They had no tool to give it shape.
</p>

<p>
And once you’ve had a taste of effortless updates, it’s awfully hard to back to manual everything.
</p>

<p>
So they didn’t.
</p>

<p>
And neither did thousands of their peers. It just simply wasn’t worth it. The inertia was too strong.
</p>

<p>
The old web, the cool web, the weird web, the hand-organized web… died.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="orgc268a43">
<p>

</p>

<p>
And the damn reverse chronology bias — once called into creation, it hungers eternally — sought its next victim. Myspace. Facebook. Twitter. Instagram. Pinterest, of all things. Today these social publishing tools are beginning to buck reverse chronological sort; they’re introducing algorithm sort, to surface content not by time posted but by popularity, or expected interactions, based on individual and group history. There is even less control than ever before.
</p>

<p>
There are no more quirky homepages.
</p>

<p>
There are no more amateur research librarians.
</p>

<p>
All thanks to a quirky bit of software produced to alleviate the pain of a tiny subset of a very small audience.
</p>

<p>
That’s not cool at all.
