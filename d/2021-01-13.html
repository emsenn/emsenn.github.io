Last night I spent some time helping <a href="../chiya.html">@chiya</a> and <a href="../books.html">@Books</a> get <a href="../emacs.html">Emacs</a> installed on their system. Both have the apparent goal of following roughly in my footsteps, and using the <a href="../text_editor.html">text editor</a> as, primarily, a <a href="../note_taking_system.html">note-taking system</a>.
</p>

<p>
The biggest hang-up was an "unhelpful" error message from <a href="../straight_el.html">straight.el</a> that was only occuring on @chiya's <a href="../computer.html">computer</a>, but not @Books'! It kept complaining that the <a href="../bootstrapping.html">bootstrapping</a> file didn't exist. After spending way too long saying "I don't know why it's not working!" I finally realized: @chiya didn't have <a href="../git.html">Git</a> installed, while @Books did. @chiya installed Git, and that solved it neatly.
</p>

<p>
I've given both a fairly simple configuration file for their <a href="../emacsen.html">Emacsen</a>, I'll include it down below. It uses <a href="../org_mode.html">Org-mode</a>, but isn't set up to use <a href="../org-roam.html">Org-roam</a> yet, since both of them are using <a href="../windows_10.html">Windows 10</a> as their host <a href="../operating-system.html">operating system</a> and I'm not confident in my ability to walk people through installing and configuring  <a href="../sqlite.html">SQLite</a> over the phone, essentially.
</p>

<p>
But, with what they've both got set up, and their own comfort with teaching themselves <a href="../software.html">software</a>, I think the more important thing going forward is going to be&#x2026; helping explain my perspective on <a href="../note_taking.html">note-taking</a>, <a href="../record.html">records</a>, and making a <a href="../website.html">Website</a>.
</p>

<p>
I'm curious if I have enough notes on taking notes, within my <a href="../note_taking_system.html">note-taking system</a>, <a href="../index.html">my records catalog</a>, to cobble together anything meaningful to say on taking notes.
</p>

<p>
<i>(From here, this post will be kind of meta, about using Org-roam and Org-mode to find <a href="../information.html">information</a> in my own notes.)</i>
</p>

<p>
Seems a reasonable place to start is by looking at my record for terms like <a href="../note.html">notes</a> and <a href="../note_taking.html">note-taking</a>.
</p>

<p>
Reading through the excerpted content around <a href="../backlink.html">backlinks</a> to those terms isn't really turning up any information that'll be suitable for sharing with others to teach them anything, but it is nice watching myself talk about taking notes over the last month and slowly stabilize my <a href="../vernacular.html">vernacular</a>.
</p>

<p>
It does link to two records that seem like they'll be useful:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="../jethro-kuan-how-to-take-smart-notes-with-org-mode.html">Jethro Kuan: "How To Take Smart Notes with Org-mode"</a></li>
<li><a href="../lion-kimbro.html">Lion Kimbro</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
The former has quotes from <a href="../jethro_kuan.html">Kuan</a>'s blog post, and the latter has an interview between Kimbro and <a href="../giles_turnbull.html">Giles Turnbull</a> about Kimbro's extensive use of taking notes.
</p>

<p>
From Kuan's blog post:
</p>

<blockquote id="orgdd7caeb">
<p>
You have a bunch of unrefined ideas sitting around, thoughts you had speaking with friends, or from reading something on the web. Link them up together, and you have a paper. Instead of beginning with the research question, and going top down, we begin with the notes, and build and refine ideas from the bottom up. This also breaks writing down into small, reasonable steps (one note at a time).
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="org50da4fe">
<p>
The primary purpose of note-taking should not be for storing ideas, but for developing them. When we take notes, we should ask: “In what context do I want to see this note again?”
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
From Lion's interview:
</p>

<blockquote id="org417d4a2">
<p>
I wanted to see if I could make myself smarter, by strategically placing notes to myself.
</p>

<p>
Intelligence, as I define it, is: Getting the right information at the right time at the right place, towards whatever end you are going for.
</p>

<p>
So, to use the “Getting Things Done” analogy: You’re at home, and you realize you need to get a Philip’s screwdriver. If, the next day, you’re walking down the street, and you walk by a hardware store- if you don’t think to get the screwdriver, that’s an “Intelligence Failure.” You’re not getting the right information, at the right time, at the right place.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="org282ffb5">
<p>
I learned a LOT of things, by doing this. I’ll pick one, for example:
</p>

<p>
I remember the feeling of realizing, for the very first time, that if you wanted to know what your values were, you should look at your goals. And if you want to know what your goals should be, you should look at your values.
</p>

<p>
How did I learn that? I didn’t learn it from a self-help book. Maybe I’d heard it before, maybe not, but I certainly never realized it before.
</p>

<p>
But it came out, mechanically, just by doing the calculations. (By calculations, I mean: The steps of the notebook system- applying the introspection.)
</p>

<p>
Things like that would just “open up,” spontaneously. Out of the blue. But when I sawthings like that, it became apparent to me that that there are these deep systems in our minds. That there’s just ages of structure there. It’s like finding Atlantis.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="org58c9d41">
<p>
Let me explain, concretely, the kinds of things that happen.
</p>

<p>
You find yourself reaching towards some objective. Your notes are strategy notes, mental puzzling, things like that, to reach the objective. It all goes into the notebook system. Then you have some questions about life. They seem unrelated. It all goes into the notebook system. Then you realize that the objective is important to you. That goes into the notebook system. How do you place “important?” Well, that’s connected to your life. But now it’s also attached to your objective. A line is literally drawn between the objectives, and the questions about life. You now consider them together.
</p>

<p>
Then you see this, and that becomes a thought. It goes into the notebook system. You pay attention to this: You realize (because, it’s there, graphically, right in front of you) that your notions about life are intricately connected to your objectives. Before, you thought you were just doing it for fun. But afterwards, you realize that it’s part of this causal chain.
</p>

<p>
It feels like a mystery novel, or a fairy tale.
</p>

<p>
You ask questions. Remember: You have all the time in the world now. When you were in school, you had to whip something out and go to the next topic. But here, you have your whole life ahead of you, to figure things out with. So, it’s very nice. You ask questions that you never asked before, like: “Why is this important to me?”
</p>

<p>
If you hold any question in mind long enough, you eventually find the answer. You read something, and it has the answer to your question. We’re just surrounded by information: Just holding a question in mind is enough.
</p>

<p>
The answer comes, you integrate it into your database. Everything checks out? Good: You’re golden.
</p>

<p>
So, you start to recognize, quite clearly, because it’s all in your conscious mind, the structure of your life. Why you do things. What your REAL beliefs are. What things are core, and what things aren’t. You hook your ideas up together- ideas about society, communication, personal identity, and systems in general. (At least, that’s how it came up in my 2D graph, from a high-level perspective.)
</p>

<p>
And you see the pieces chink into place.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And here's a quote from Lion's book, <a href="../lion-kimbro-how-to-make-a-complete-map-of-every-thought-you-think.html">"How to make a complete map of every thought you think"</a>:
</p>

<blockquote id="orgf615591">
<p>
You don’t have to impress anybody. There’s nobody to impress. You don’t have to hurry up– you have all the time in the world.
</p>

<p>
So you can- very patiently- figure out what questions are important to you. You can figure out just where exactly your attention is- what you are doing. You can do this all, more or less, in the privacy of your notebook.
</p>

<p>
You can think about “hidden subjects”- things that are REALLY important, but that people don’t have the time to think about. Such as: “How do we communicate?” “How is thinking structured?” “What am I doing?”, etc.
</p>

<p>
And you find answers.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Looking at all those quotes together, I think I'd sum them up like this: "Take notes to find questions you ask yourself." Obviously, learning the answer is the the work that will be done with such questions, but that is, I think, more <a href="../cognition.html">internal</a>. Taking notes itself, is to find the questions.
</p>

<p>
Which is, put like that, weirdly close to the tagline I have used for <a href="../brave_old_world.html">Brave Old World</a> at times: "Tell stories to answer questions about the world."
</p>

<p>
It <a href="../begs-the-question.html">begs the question</a> of what similarities there are between my <a href="../tabletop-role-playing-game-system.html">tabletop role-playing game system</a> and my <a href="../note_taking_system.html">note-taking system</a>. Certainly, many superficial ones, since the game system is developed through using the note-taking system, and implemented in it, but I'm curious what other <a href="../relationships.html">relationships</a> exist between the two systems. <a href="../food-for-thought.html">Food for thought</a>.

<a href="2021-01-12.html">Yesterday</a> I wrote that <a href="2021-01-12.html#you-should-write">"You should write"</a>, to extend on other posts I've seen on the <a href="../web.html">Web</a> saying that you should write a blog. I'd like to take a different perspective now, and really clarify, you should write for yourself first, whether or not you decide to share your writing on the Web. 
</p>

<p>
I really do mean <i>share</i> your writing on the Web. The Web, or any external audience, shouldn't be the primary reason you're writing, especially not taking notes.
</p>

<p>
Why shouldn't you write straight for the Web? I don't think we have ever had the Web that its participants intended for themsleves.

<p>
Let me start with <a href="https://gilest.org/2004/interview-with-lion-kimbro/">an interview between Giles Turnbull and Lion Kimbro</a>. Here's what Kimbro had to say about <a href="../wiki.html">wikis</a>, way back in 2004.
</p>

<blockquote id="org855800b">
<p>
Wiki, briefly, are the hottest thing in Social Software right now. All this “friendster” stuff is important, but it’s just a ruse. People don’t see the real revolution that wiki represents.
</p>

<p>
Wiki is terribly important because it’s the first public communication system that is DOCUMENT based.
</p>

<p>
Instant Messaging, E-Mail, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), Online Message Boards, all this stuff-
</p>

<p>
It’s all MESSAGE based.
</p>

<p>
It’s a “quick signal.” You send a message to someone, and they do something different than they would have done before. “Someone.” Sometimes even a group of people. Maybe you’re on a mailing list, or something.
</p>

<p>
After the message is done, it’s spent. It’s indexed by Google, and someone looking for something can find your message amidst a sea of messages, and try to apply it to their situation.
</p>

<p>
But wiki is totally different. It’s document based. The fundamental element of a wiki is the document. It’s not a one-off message. (Though, you CAN attach messages to the bottom of a wiki page. Very common.) It’s something that people can use, and refer back to, time and time again.
</p>

<p>
It’s made to exist across time.
</p>

<p>
And so, also, that means that you get a sense of “space.” You can point two wiki towards each other. You can’t point two mailing lists at each other. To do that, you’d have to have some program that automatically mails, every day, the same message over and over again. People would hate that. You can’t network mailing lists, without the aid of static web pages. But then: People can’t affect those, unless they are site administrators. So you are really constrained with what you can do.
</p>

<p>
Wiki is the only document based public system. That means that wiki (or something just like wiki, integrated into another system,) will be the vehicle by which our online conversations all organize themselves.
</p>

<p>
It’s my notebook system, ALL OVER AGAIN. In the notebook system, related things get pointed at each other, and then “move” on the grand map towards one another.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Since this interview, the world of wiki contracted. (See my earlier post, <a href="2021-01-07.html#world-of-wiki-that-wasnt">"The world of wikis that wasn't"</a>)
</p>

<p>
But this goal, of a <a href="../web.html">Web</a> that is simply a lot of connected documents that use <a href="../hypertext.html">hypertext</a> to reference each other, is one that one contingent or another of Web user has always been aiming for.
</p>

<p>
Most recently, the <a href="../metaphor.html">metaphor</a> of choice has been <a href="../digital_garden.html">digital garden</a>. Here's some quotes from <a href="../joel-hooks-my-blog-is-a-digital-garden-not-a-blog.html">Joel Hooks: "My blog is a digital garden, not a blog"</a> 
</p>

<blockquote id="orgb8e6ef7">

The phrase "digital garden" is a metaphor for thinking about writing and creating that focuses less on the resulting "showpiece" and more on the process, care, and craft it takes to get there.

A garden is usually a place where things grow.

Gardens can be very personal and full of whimsy or a garden can be a source of food and substance.

We gather and work together in community gardens to share the labor as well as the rewards of a collective effort.

<p>
And this movement, like the wiki movement before it, has critiques of, as Lion Kimbro would put it, the "message-based" Web.
</p>

<blockquote id="org7bc9256">
<p>
For as long as I've been writing words on the internet, I've connected the words that I create in a paginated chronological format. This is the "traditional" blog style website. A linear newest-first sorted chronologically oriented list of posts.
</p>

<p>
I'm convinced that paginated posted sorted chronologically fuckin' sucks.
</p>

<p>
Chronologically sorted pages of posts aren't how people actually use the internet.
</p>

<p>
For the most part we use search via Google to find stuff, which is free form and task oriented. You want something, you know what you want, you can string a few words together and hope to get lucky.

Joel links to <a href="../amy-hoy-how-the-blog-broke-the-web.html">Amy Hoy: "How the Blog Broke the Web"</a>, which has a good explanation of what the Web was like, prior to blogs and <a href="../social_media.html">social media</a>, for those of you reading this who are too young to remember.
</p>

<blockquote id="org39e5fc6">
<p>
The Web was so small, then. So small that it was conceivable that one could maintain a list of every site.
</p>

<p>
And it really was both new and cool to use a 1-frame-a-minute webcam to spy on a coffee machine on another continent or click a Big Red Button That Does Nothing.
</p>

<p>
Back then, we didn’t have platforms or feeds or social networks or… blogs.
</p>

<p>
We had <i>homepages</i>.
</p>

<p>
The backgrounds were grey. The font, Times New Roman. Links could be any color as long as it was medium blue.[…]
</p>

<p>
Assuming you knew a handful of tags, it took about a minute to create a new web page.
</p>

<p>
There were no databases to configure. No scripts to install. No plugins, no security patches. There were no cookies.[…]
</p>

<p>
We built every new page by hand. When we had more than one web page, we built the navigation by hand. We managed our Table of Contents by hand. We broke out our calculators to code boundaries for our image maps. We talked unironically about “hyperlinks.”[…]
</p>

<p>
No two homepages were alike. There was certainly no such thing as a Content Management System. But it didn’t mean that the homepage content wasn’t managed.[…]
</p>

<p>
Dates didn’t matter all that much. Content lasted longer; there was less of it. Older content remained in view, too, because the dominant metaphor was table of contents rather than diary entry.
</p>

<p>
Everyone with a homepage became a de facto amateur reference librarian.
</p>

<p>
Obviously, it didn’t last.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The post goes on to talk about the early history of blogs, and talks about the introduction of <a href="../movable-type.html">Movable Type</a>, one of the first <a href="../content-management-system.html">content management systems</a>.
</p>

<blockquote id="orgd8987c0">
<p>
The first real movement came in 2001. That’s when there debuted an invention that would revolutionize the way people across the globe distributed their written content:
</p>

<p>
Movable Type.[…]
</p>

<p>
MT wasn’t the first tool to facilitate rapid web publishing, but it was the first powerful one that appealed to the tweakers, the do-it-yourselfers, the webmonkeys.[…]
</p>

<p>
It was the first viable alternative to all that manual work. It made updating a weblog easy. Without giving up total control.[…]
</p>

<p>
Movable Type wasn’t a revolution, technically speaking. It wasn’t a live web app like the CMSes of today; it didn’t serve up dynamic content. It wasn’t fancy.[…]
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
From there, Hoy talks about the cultural effect this had:
</p>

<p>
Culturally, though, it was devastating.
</p>

<p>
And then relates it to the choices of the people making Websites:
</p>

<blockquote id="orgd7879ab">
<p>
That’s what happened as Movable Type ate the blogosphere.
</p>

<p>
Homepage production became suddenly a question of economics:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Go with the system’s default format: zero work.</li>
<li>Customizing the system to your format: way more work than pure HTML ever was</li>
</ol>

<p>
And who, once offered a path of least resistance, has the energy to fight it all the way?
</p>

<p>
The format won.
</p>

<p>
It was easier — faster! — to literally go with the flow… of time.[…]
</p>

<p>
Thus began the Chronological Sort Era.
</p>

<p>
Or, as I like to call it:
</p>

<p>
CHRONOS RULES EVERYTHING AROUND ME.
</p>

<p>
Movable Type didn’t just kill off blog customization.
</p>

<p>
It (and its competitors) actively killed other forms of web production.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
All this reminds me of a piece I read back in October, that <a href="../phil_hagelberg.html">@technomancy</a> had brought to my attention: <a href="../fred-hebert-you-reap-what-you-code.html">Fred Hebert: "You Reap What You Code"</a>, and that I relied on heavily when writing <a href="2020-10-29.html#on-decolonizing-my-web-use">"On decolonizing my Web use"</a>. Hebert relays the concept of the <a href="../oppressive-monopoly.html">oppressive monopoly</a> and relates it to <a href="../computer_atuomation.html">computer automation</a>, arguing that we have become trapped by bad automations. First, Hebert relaying Illich's oppressive monopoly:
</p>

<blockquote id="org09dbd23">
<p>
Rather than having a merchant bring goods to the town square, the milkman drop milk on the porch, and markets smaller and distributed closer to where they’d be convenient, it is now everyone’s job to drive for each of these things while stores go to where land is cheap rather than where people are. And when society develops with a car in mind, you now need a car to be functional.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
To me, this introduction of cars sounds very much like the introduction of a Movable Type. Hebert has the same sort of questions as Hoy, too. From Hebert's piece:
</p>

<blockquote id="org21c517f">
<p>
What are the things we do that we perceive increase our ability to do things, but turn out to actually end up costing us a lot more to just participate?
</p>

<p>
We kind of see it with our ability to use all the bandwidth a user may have; trying to use old dial-up connections is flat out unworkable these days. But do we have the same with our cognitive cost? The tooling, the documentation, the procedures?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Hebert is talking about systems that you make yourself though, while Hoy was talking about people using systems that other people have made for them. Hebert's concerns about "brittle automation" should be even more chilling then when looking at the Web and how we produce "content" for it.
</p>

<blockquote id="orgf60acf8">
<p>
And here we fall into the old idea that if you are as clever as you can to write something, you’re in trouble because you need to be doubly as clever to debug it.
</p>

<p>
That’s because to debug a system that is misbehaving under automation, you need to understand the system, and then understand the automation, then understand what the automation thinks of the system, and then take action.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="org3e48478">
<p>
[E]ssentially, brittle automation forces you to know more than if you had no automation in order to make things work in difficult times.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
All of this is to make the argument that the Web has never really been what it was meant to be, because brittle automations combined with the influence of market economics has prevented it.
</p>

<p>
From my writing on decolonizing my Web use:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Automation shifts the conductor to the role of monitor, who is now not doing anything but must still be aware of the task, in case something anomalous happens, so the monitor can become the conductor again.
</p>
<p>
This introduces two problems: it’s hard to pay attention if you aren’t doing anything, and if you only handle emergencies, you might not be well-practiced to handle them when they arise.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Again, all this to say: write for yourself, <i>then</i> share it on the Web.
</p>

<p>
So writing for <i>the Web</i> seems, given the current automations and models in place, seems like it'll fail, if your intention is to capture any of the traditional benefits of writing. If your intention is to use a less-traditional writing method, like a note-taking system, it seems even less likely that the dominant paradigm of Web communications is going to work for you.
</p>

<p>
But writing for <i>yourself</i>, and then <i>sharing</i> some of that on the Web, allows you to focus on capturing the traditional benefits of writing, or the more strange benefits of note-taking, and then provide some of the results with the Web.
</p>

<p>
I still haven't answered why you should share your writing on the Web. At the moment, there aren't other places for this sort of writing. If you are an academic, you might be able to take some notes and turn them into papers that are of use to other people, but otherwise, there's simply not a place for it. Wikipedia doesn't what your personal opinion of an actor, or your relationship with a bit of slang. Blogs, as Hoy argues, don't make space for it.
</p>

<p>
Share your notes with the Web because if you don't, there's no place to share them. And they might be useful. Pulling together an interview from 2004 about wikis and a blog post from 2017 about blogs to talk about digital gardens in 2020 is a rather&#x2026; niche demonstration of why shared writing.
