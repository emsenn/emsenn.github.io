I know I've said this like, five days in a row, but I think I'm finally coming out of the weeds, with regards to transitioning back to the <a href="../20201215150459-emacs.html">Emacs</a> and <a href="../20201219134812-org_ecosystem.html">Org ecosystem</a> for my <a href="../20201216101922-information_management.html">information management</a> and <a href="../20201222102319-web_performance.html">Web performance</a>. I've got <a href="../20201216154325-org_roam_capture_templates.html">Org-roam capture templates</a> and <a href="../20201217210024-org_roam_daily_capture_templates.html">Org-roam daily capture templates</a> set up for easily creating both <a href="../20201222102711-permanent_note.html">permanent</a> and <a href="../20201222102950-fleeting_notes.html">fleeting notes</a> as <a href="../20201217220539-record.html">records</a>, and a way to (simply, and with a lot of lost <a href="../20201216103303-meta_data.html">context</a>) publish those records as a <a href="../20201215151949-website.html">Website</a>.
</p>

<p>
I've been heavily inspired by seeing <a href="../20201219112531-jeremy_friesen.html">Jeremy Friesen</a>'s own Website, <a href="https://takeonrules.com/">takeonrules.com</a>. While the <a href="../20201215154153-tool.html">tools</a> he uses to build the site are not entirely the tools I plan to use, there's a lot of overlap, and the presentation of his site <i>is</i> very close to the presentation I'd like mine to have.
</p>

<p>
I've also been using <a href="../20201222103314-neil_mather.html">Neil Mather</a>'s Website as a bit of a reference - and just now noticed, actually, that Neil and I follow each other in the <a href="../20201222103740-fediverse.html">Fediverse</a> and have been talking a bit about me preparing my own Website! Small <a href="../20201216102657-world.html">world</a>.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully, all this means that I'm far enough along that I can start using my Website to broadcast <a href="../20201222104010-posting.html">postings</a> again, like I was doing briefly with my <a href="../20201222104247-wordpress.html">Wordpress</a>, starting today. As I go I'll develop the other records that'll be stored on the <a href="https://emsenn.net">emsenn.net</a>.
</p>

<p>
I haven't written too much about it, but I see this <a href="../20201217113603-digital_garden.html">digital garden</a> as having potential as a tool for facilitating <a href="../20201222104437-cross_cultural_communication.html">cross-cultural communication</a>, and perhaps even having a role in me <a href="../20201222104622-live_streaming.html">live-streaming</a>, especially when such streams inevitably turn to the topic of <a href="../20201216101403-decolonization.html">decolonization</a>.
